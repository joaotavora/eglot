    these functions and to use the Emacs imenu library to display programming identifiers defined
    within the same file in which they are referenced.  This works without a TAGS file and on files
    that have not yet been evaluated within the current Emacs session.
               (hkey-alist): Added imenu support: Action Key press on an imenu identifier displays
    its definition; Assist Key press prompts with completion for an identifier defined within the
    current buffer to display.

* hargs.el (hargs:find-tag-default): Added and used in hargs:at-p and hibtypes.el (hyp-address).
    This supports the newer find-tag-default-function which may be major-mode specific.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Added support to recognized key sequences in GNU standard Info manuals where
    they are surrounded by a form of smart quotes.

    displays Org mode links in a web browser and cycles through outline headings.
  hibtypes.el (require 'hsys-org): Added.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons - org-mode):
  DEMO (Org Mode): Updated doc to reflect this behavior.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Added optional 5th arg, LIST-POSITIONS-FLAG, which
    if non-nil makes the return value a list of (string-matched start-pos end pos).
    This is used for flashing any matching implicit button when activated.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-backward-item, hui:menu-forward-item): Added these to move
    point through minibuffer menu items; bound to SHIFT-TAB (or M-TAB) and to TAB.

* hmouse-info.el: Renamed for consistency from hmous-info.el.
    (require 'info): Added to be sure this is always loaded.

* hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): If lookup as a node fails, try it as an index
    item name.  This allows for implicit links of the type "(file)index-item-name".

* hui.el (hui:link-directly): Removed any text properties from string arguments in
    case they are unintentially copied.

2016-07-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:link-directly): Updated message after creation to include arguments
    so the user sees what is linked to.

* hmous-info.el (Info-handle-in-menu): Called Info-menu-item-at-point.
                (Info-note-at-p): Added.

  hargs.el (hargs:at-p): When reading an Info-node or Info-index-item, if point is
    on a cross-reference or menu item, make the link to that item, not to the
    current Info node.
  hmous-info.el (Info-read-index-item-name, Info-build-menu-item-completions,
    Info-complete-menu-item, Info-current-filename-sans-extension,
    Info-menu-item-at-p, Info-node-has-menu-p, Info-read-index-item-name-1): Added.
  hui.el (hui:link-possible-types):
  hactypes.el (link-to-Info-index-item):
  hargs.el (hargs:iforms-extensions, hargs:at-p): Added link-to-Info-index-item
    action type (interactive spec of +X) with full completion of Info index nodes
    across all installed Info manuals (at link creation time).  Added to
    documentation.
  DEMO (Info Paths): Updated to include index item links.

* hact.el (action:params): Changed to return nil if ACTION argument is an Emacs
    byte-coded function with a variable number of arguments in which case the
    function parameters are not available.  This fixed an error in the function
    kotl-mode where it expected a list to be returned, bug#23873.

2016-06-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

==============================================================================
V5.15 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2016-06-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hvm.el, hui-xe-but.el, kotl/kprop-xe.el: Set to not byte compile since will be rarely
    used and reduces the byte-compiler warnings.

* hactypes.el: Replaced comint-kill-output with newer comint-delete-output.
    Replaced shell-sent-input with comint-send-input.

* hui-em-but.el: Added hyperbole group for all faces.

* hmouse-key.el (require 'hsite): Added this and replaced require of hversion so
    hmouse-middle-flag is defined at compile-time.

* hmh.el (Mh-to): Removed called to no longer existing Mh-get-buffer and changed variable name
    to currently used mh-show-buffer (all lower-case).

* hib-doc-id.el (require 'wrolo): Added for rolo-grep calls.

* hmouse-tag.el (eval-and-compile): Added this call around requires and loads.

* kotl/kimport.el (require 'kfile): Added.
  kotl/kcell.el (require 'kview): Added.

* All Files (with-current-buffer): Used in place of (save-excursion (set-buffer...))

* wrolo.el, wrolo-logic.el, wconfig.el, kotl/kexport.el, hvm.el, hui.el, hui-select.el:
    Replaced all remaining calls of (interactive-p) with
    (called-interactively-p 'interactive).

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Moved to hyperbole.el to resolve a compile-time warning.
  hload-path.el: Added and moved load-path settings from hversion.el and hyperbole.el here
    and required this file in hversion.el.  This is so the kotl/ directory is added to
    load-path when just hversion.el is required.  This fixes an issue in hinit.el which
    required hibtypes.el which required klink.el before kotl/ was in the load-path.
  hversion.el (hyperb:kotl-p): Moved Koutline mode initializations from hyperbole.el
    to here since hversion is sometimes required at compile time without requiring
    the hyperbole library and we need the kotl/ subdirectory on load-path then.
  kotl/kimport.el (kimport:mode-alist, kimport:suffix-alist): Moved these 2 definitions
    from hyperbole.el back into this file since they are autoloaded and only used herein.
  hgnus.el (require 'hypb): Added.
  hsmail.el (smail:comment-add): Rewrote as a no-op if inhibit-hyperbole-messaging is nil.
            (message-setup-hook, mh-letter-mode-hook): Changed to use add-hook rather than
    var:append.  This solved a compile-time problem where inhibit-hyperbole-messaging was
    not yet defined (from hyperbole.el) but was used in the var:append call.

* htz.el (htz:span-in-days): Renamed call of calendar-absolute-from-julian
    to newer calendar-julian-to-absolute.

* hsmail.el (var:append): Fixed issue where inhibit-hyperbole-messaging was not defined
    at compile time, causing a failure of hgnus.el (which requires hsmail) to compile.
  hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-query:status): Added (require 'debbugs-gnu).
  hib-doc-id.el:
  hib-kbd.el:
  hib-debbugs.el (require 'hactypes): Added missing require and eval-when-compile
    needed for package compilation.
  hact.el, hactypes.el, hbut.el, hgnus.el, hinit.el, hmh.el, hrmail.el, hui-menu.el,
  hversion.el, hypb.el, kotl/kcell.el, kotl/kfile.el, kotl/kotl-mode.el, kotl/kview.el:
    Added eval-when-compile needed for package compilation.

==============================================================================

2016-06-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Fixed menubar Manual pointers for Find,
    Koutliner, and Screen.  Also renamed Hyperbole submenu to Koutliner from
    Koutline to distinguish it from the mode-specific Koutline menubar menu.
  hversion.el (id-info-item): Added and used in menubar menus to go to Info index entries.
              (id-info): Trigged an error if argument is not a string.
	      (infodock-hyperbole-menu):

* HY-README: Expanded the installation instructions here with additional pointers.

* hpath.el (hpath:get-external-display-alist): Renamed from hpath:find-alist and
    changed it from a variable to a function so it is resolved on a per-frame basis
    since each frame may have different window-system value when using distributed
    window systems.  Improved documentation.
	   (hpath:external-display-alist-macos)
	   (hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows)
	   (hpath:external-display-alist-x): Added these variables for use with
    each window system.
           (hpath:internal-display-alist): Renamed from hpath:display-alist.

* hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): Updated doc to explain that completion is
    available and there is no need to include a .info suffix for the filename.

* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-gnu-query, debbugs-gnu-query:string): Fixed some edge
    cases with internal and trailing spacing.

* DEMO (Thing Selection): Added this section.

* hpath.el (hpath:find-file-urls-p): Removed message and beep call; made a pure predicate.
           (hpath:enable-find-file-urls): Added a beep and message if called interactively
   and no remote path library is loaded.

2016-06-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* DEMO (HyControl, Creating and Modifying Explicit Buttons): Added these sections.
    Reworked and updated the demo to reflect the current state of Hyperbole.

* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Fixed bug where point was left on a button different than
    the one operated upon by changing (forward-char 1) to (forward-char 2).

* hargs.el (hargs:iforms-extensions): Simplified ?I (read an Info-node name) to call
    Info-read-node-name.  This allows use of filename prefixes without the .info suffix,
    e.g. (hyperbole) while still supplying completions.

* hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): Changed to call match-string-no-properties.

* hibtypes.el (man-apropos): Fixed for new Emacs versions.
    (rfc): Fixed to allow a space in the middle to match documentation.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Moved the Types menu below the
    Documentation menu to match the Hyperbole minibuffer menu.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added Types item on the Explicit Buttons menu to display
    action types; this matches the same item from the IBut menu.

* DEMO: Removed description of Cust/Find-File-URLs as this is a bit advanced.  Doc is
    available instead at "(hyperbole)Using URLs with Find-File".
  man/hyperbole.texi (Using URLs with Find-File): Fixed to refer to the newer name,
    hpath:find-file-urls-mode rather than hyperb:find-file-urls-mode.

* DEMO (Path Suffixes and Variables): Added this section with more examples and removed
    description of hpath:display-alist; documented in the Hyperbole Manual instead.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Internal Viewers): Added description of file formats supported
    by the default setting of hpath:display-alist.

* hibtypes.el (pathname): Excluded paths that start with ~ from expansion via
    load-path matching and changed to call locate-library so compressed Lisp files
    are found.  Added support for Info filenames without any path (displays Top node).
  hpath.el (hpath:info-suffix): Added and used in hpath:display-alist and implicit
    type pathname definition.

2016-06-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:display-alist): Added audio format mp3, wav and ogg suffixes.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Link Variable Substitution): Small text fixes.

2016-06-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-inactive-minibuffer-p): Added and used at the
    start of hmouse-alist.  This added Smart Key support for an inactive
    minibuffer.  Action Mouse Key click displays the Hyperbole minibuffer
    menu for easy item selection with the Action Mouse Key.  Assist
    Mouse Key click pops up the jump menu of frames, buffers and windows,
    just as a blank area in the modeline does.
                (action-key-minibuffer-function, assist-key-minibuffer-function):
    Added these variables and used at the start of hmouse-alist.
                (action-key-modeline-function, assist-key-modeline-function):
    Changed name from *-hook since should only be set to a single function.

2016-06-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-depress-inactive-minibuffer-p): Added and used in
    action-key-depress and assist-key-depress.
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-shifted-setup): For GNU Emacs, changed
    hmouse-set-point-command to hmouse-move-point-emacs.
    (hmouse-move-point-emacs): Added.

* hycontrol.el (frame-pixel-*): Changed all these calls to hycontrol-frame-*
    to include any window manager decorations in the calculation.
               (hycontrol-frame-height, hycontrol-frame-width): Added.

* hyperbole.el (hyperbole, hyperbole-keys): Added these customization
    groups; used by hmouse-mod.el.
  hmouse-mod.el (hmouse-mod-disable): Renamed from hmouse-mod-unset-global-map.
    (hmouse-mod-enable): Renamed from hmouse-mod-set-global-map.
    (hmouse-mod-mode): Added this to make it a minor mode and replaced
  hmouse-mod-toggle.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added Chord Keyboard entry.
                     (Smart Key Modifiers, Smart Key Modeline): Added
    these sections.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Tightened to not match when point is on the
   outside curly brace characters, thereby allowing hui-select-delimited-thing
   to select the delimited key sequence.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Added debbugs-gnu-query doc.

2016-06-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Operations): Updated this section and
    fixed documentation error concerning where to click the Action Mouse
    Key to bring up the Info Browser.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Changed from Doc/SmartKy to Doc/SmartKeys.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-summarize): Made interactive so can be bound to a key.
    Deleted return to previously selected window, so can browse through
    the help and then use {q} to restore the window configuration.
  hui-mouse.el (action-key-error): Changed to call hypb:error.
               (assist-key-error): Added and changed assist-key-default-function
    to default to this, since its prior value, hkey-summarize, is
    performed by an Assist Key click in the right of a modeline.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Added &, ~, and ^ as identifier
    characters and removed #.

2016-06-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (hattr:report): Simplified conditionals and printing via format.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-help): Fixed to handle windows already split side-by-side
    and to leave point in the help buffer (so can use {q} to quit) if not called
    from within the minibuffer, e.g. when on an implicit button.

2016-06-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-doc, hui:menu-item-doc): Added and added
    parameters to their callers to allow for return of menu item
    documentation strings used by implicit keyboard buttons in hib-kbd.el.
    This allowed display of documentation of Hyperbole minibuffer menu
    items from readable key sequence strings via the Assist Key.

 hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Added support for RETURN fully spelled out.
             (kbd-key:hyperbole-menu-key-p): Added.
             (kbd-key:doc): Added error if no doc found for a key-sequence.
             (ibtypes::kbd-key, kbd-key:act): Added support for invoking Hyperbole
    minibuffer menu items with the Action Key when over a sequence of keys
    like, e.g. {C-h h d d}.
             (kbd-key:normalize): Added error if argument is not a string.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-set-buffer-and-point): Added.
    (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point, hmouse-goto-depress-point,
     hmouse-goto-region-point, hmouse-goto-release-point): Called `hmouse-set-buffer-and-point'.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-gnus-summary, smart-gnus-summary-assist): Changed from
    no-longer existing call of `gnus-summary-mark-unread-forward/backward' to
    `gnus-summary-mark-article-as-unread'.

2016-06-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* wrolo.el (rolo-sort-lines): Added to handle sorting of collapsed rolo
   records properly since through Emacs 25.0 invisible lines are not
   grouped with the prior visible line, making rolo entry (or any record)
   sorts fail.  This function fixes that.
           (rolo-forward-visible-line): Added to support rolo-sort-lines.

2016-06-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term): Added per frame check for mouse
   support, notably for graphical emacsclient spawned from a non-graphical
   Emacs.  Previously such clients did not have Hyperbole mouse support;
   now they do.
     (hyperb:window-sys-term): Changed to take a single frame argument and
       set the value of 'hyperb:window-system into the frame parameters.
     (hyperb:window-system): Deleted this variable; now should be
       called as a function only.  Added this as a function to return the
       frame-specific value of `hyperb:window-system'.
  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-operate, hmouse-set-point):
  hypb.el (hypb:configuration):
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
  hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-window-side, hmouse-modeline-depress,
    hmouse-modeline-release, hmouse-resize-window-side, hmouse-x-coord,
    hmouse-y-coord):
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-get-bindings, hmouse-get-unshifted-bindings
    hmouse-shifted-setup, hmouse-unshifted-setup):
  hmouse-key.el (hmouse-set-bindings): Changed from variable ref to function
   call for hyperb:window-system.
  hui-window.el: Simplified hmouse-alist setup a bit.
  hui-mouse.el (hmouse-alist): Changed to always define this since one may start
    Emacs on a tty and then use a distributed window system to create a frame under
    a window system with mouse support that needs this.

2016-06-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-jmenu.el (hui-menu-of-buffers): Removed limit on top-level buffer menu length, i.e.
    the number of categories/major modes.

* man/hyperbole.texi (@var): Replaced all with @code since @var is meant for a
    different purpose.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-install): Changed to set the global value of hmouse-middle-flag
    so always know if the middle mouse button was bound by Hyperbole.
  hmouse-mod.el (DESCRIPTION): Fixed doc on adding unshifted middle button as Action Key.
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-shifted-setup): Renamed from hmouse-setup and improved documentation.
               (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Improved doc and removed use of flag argument.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Cust/KeyBindings): Added doc for C-c RET,
    syntactical region marking and C-c ., delimited thing to start and end.
    Also indicated keys which are bound only if not bound prior to loading
    Hyperbole.
* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): On Customize/Change-Key-Bindings menu, renamed
    Dragging-Actions to Drag-Emulation-Key, renamed Button-Rename to Button-Rename-Key.
    Renamed HyControl-Windows to Windows-Control-Key.  Added Mark-Thing-Key.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): On Cust/KeyBindings menu, renamed ControlWin to WinControl.
    Renamed Dragging to DragKey.  Added MarkThing.

* man/im - Replaced old images with ones generated by Mats.

==============================================================================
V5.13 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2016-06-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-jmenu.el (interactive "e"): Removed "e" from menu commands that take
    no arguments.

* hact.el (symset, htype): Moved from hbut.el because actype:create uses
    htype and htype uses symset it and hbut.el requires hact.el, so we
    can't require hbut here.  This solved an installation problem where
    hact was byte-compiled before hbut was loaded and produced an invalid
    defact/actype:create macro which then caused hactypes.el to fail
    upon loading.  Also forced a load of set.el at compile time to satisfy
    Hyperbole package builder.
  hactypes.el (hact.el): Forced a load at compile time to satisfy Hyperbole
    package builder.
  hbut.el (hversion): Added require of this library; needed for
    hyperb:microcruft-os-p definition at load time.

* kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl:
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menu-common-preamble):
  man/hyperbole.texi: Fixed all references to {C-h h o} which should have

    kotl-mode:help-key for consistency.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added Screen and Display entries.

    where the directory has been changed and a relative pathname is given
    in an error message.  Now will prompt for the directory of the path.

* hmouse-drv.el (action-key-internal, assist-key-internal): Added.
   (action-mouse-key, assist-mouse-key, action-key, assist-key): Refactored
     to call the above internal functions.  Made action-key and assist-key
     clear all the action mouse key variables so there can be no confusion
     between mouse presses and keyboard presses.

   (hkey-help-show): Generalized handling of completions buffers
    and thereby fixed an issue in Emacs 24 where completions were not showing.

* hpath.el (hpath:remote-at-p): Tightened matches to require at least one
    char after the : to prevent false matches, e.g. to node:: in Texinfo files.
           (hpath:at-p): Tightened space delimited match to exclude @ characters.

           (hpath:find-alist): Added .pdf to mac-osx-suffixes and removed
    old Interleaf and Framemaker configuration from x-suffixes.

    listed in file-name-handler-alist.

* MANIFEST: Added man/hyperbole.pdf printable manual version to the distribution.
  Makefile (dvi, ps): Removed .dvi and .ps outputs and replaced with just .pdf.
           (distclean): Remove im/*.ps unneeded files and temp files used
    in hyperbole.pdf generation.

2016-06-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi: Typos and various small changes throughout.
    Redid image insertion so is no longer conditionalized by output type
    and uses @image and @caption.

* Makefile:
  HY-WHY.kotl: Added this file as a quick list of reasons to use
    Hyperbole.  More are welcome.

2016-06-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Fixed to not return an empty string.

* hyperbole.el (unless (fboundp 'kotl-mode)): If this is not bound, load
    autoloads file, e.g. when loading Hyperbole other than as an Emacs
    package.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Changed to not try to resolve executable paths
    that begin with a modifier character.

2016-06-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    hmouse-drv.el where the release function are.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:remove-cell-attribute): Added.
    (kotl-mode:transpose-chars): Improved error handling at the beginning of
       cells and end of lines.

2016-06-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:set-cell-attribute): Fixed interactive part,
    added error if called non-interactively in a read-only buffer
    and improved prompts.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:set-buffer): Renamed from kview:set-buffer-name
    since it could get out of sync if some other library changed the
    buffer name leading to kview:buffer returning nil.  Now the buffer
    itself is stored.
  kotl/kfile.el (kfile:write): Called kview:set-buffer.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Added missing {C-c C-i} binding
    mentioned in the EXAMPLE.kotl file; sets cell attributes.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-thing-with-mouse): Rewrote to better match

    (hmouse-mod-set-global-map, hmouse-mod-unset-global-map): Modified to
      save the prior global map and restore it later.
    (hmouse-mod-execute-command): Added setting of prefix argument for
      commands and made to support any self-inserting-character.
    (hmouse-mod-toggle): Added to toggle this on and off.

                (smart-java-keywords, smart-c++-keywords,
                 smart-c-keywords, smart-objc-keywords, smart-python-keywords):
    Added to prevent tag matches in smart-*-at-tag-p.
		(smart-asm-at-tag-p, smart-c-at-tag-p)
                 smart-fortran-at-tag-p, smart-lisp-at-tag-p):
    Added optional no-flash parameter for when called after button has
    already been flashed.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Removed {C-c C-t} binding for
    hmouse-toggle-bindings to force the user to invoke this command by name or
    to bind it themselves, so they really know what they are doing before use.

    Suggested a personal binding if needed.
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize): Removed {C-c C-t} global binding.

    hmouse-middle-flag as a parameter and to use var:add-and-run-hook.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-bound-symbol-def): Added with fix for if one
    of the 3 functions called herein triggers an error.  Previously, the
    condition-case was outside of all three, preventing testing each in turn
    if one signaled an error.

    above function here.

* wrolo.el (rolo-bbdb-grep): Modified to make buffer unmodified and set to

    hyperb:dir is not yet in the load-path but load-file-name is set.
    (inhibit-hyperbole-messaging): Added this variable with a default of t.
       When t, Hyperbole will not alter messaging mode hooks nor overload
       functions from these packages, preventing potential
       incompatibilities.
  hvar.el (var:append): Does nothing when inhibit-var-append is non-nil.
          (var:append): Simplified and saved additions for possible future removal.
          (var:append-all, var:remove, var:remove-all): Added.
  hyperbole (hyperbole-toggle-messaging): Added.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Toggle-Messaging-Explicit-Buttons.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Buttons in Mail, Buttons in News): Updated these
    sections to document new ability to toggle messaging ebut support on
    and off.

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Changed var:append call to add-hook.
  hsite-ex.el (hui:but-flash): GNU Emacs now has faces on ttys, so enabled
    explicit button flashing on them.  Changed var:append call to add-hook.

* hui-mouse.el (outline): Rewrote hook adding and supported outline-minor-mode.

* hypb.el (hypb:rgrep): Improved pattern quoting, dynamically changing
    pattern delimeters when patterns contain quote marks.  Still need to
    backslash double quotes in patterns.

* hsmail.el (smail:comment): Disabled by default since not many people
    ever embedded buttons in mail.

* hypb.el (hypb:toggle-isearch-invisible): Added and used in menus.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Toggle-Isearch-Invisible-Text,
    most useful in the Koutliner to allow searching only within visible
    text if desired.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added matching Isearch-Invisible item.

2016-05-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:reveal-toggle-invisible): Added to cleanly
    handle isearch temporary showing of invisible text and to leave any
    isearch exit point visible.

* hibtypes.el (pathname): Tightened to ignore matches in dired and buffer
    menu modes.

* hyperbole.el (package-generate-autoloads): Let `noninteractive' be t to
    silence autoload generation messages.  (Former value of
    inhibit-message is not defined in some V24 Emacs.

* kotl/kimport.el (kimport:aug-post-outline, kimport:star-outline,
    kimport:text): Fixed to handle now that count-matches when called
    non-interactively returns its value rather than printing it,
    eliminating the need to call read with its result.

==============================================================================
V5.11 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2016-05-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el: Hyperbole now downloads, builds and installs as a regular
   Emacs package.
  HY-README: Rewrote Obtaining and Installation instructions for Hyperbole
    as an Emacs package.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Installation): Updated with package support.
                     (By-hand Installation): Added this section.

* hyperbole-pkg.el (:keywords): Fixed to be strings.

* HY-WHY.kotl: Added to provide quick reasons to use Hyperbole.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-cell): Added missing idstamp increment
    when adding a child.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:add-cell): Simplified doc.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:kill-tree):
  kotl/kfile.el (kfile:create): Changed label to "1" as it should be.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Use kbd function first and if that does not
    help produce a key binding, manually normalize the key sequence.

* hversion.el (hyperb:stack-frame, hyperb:path-being-loaded): Moved here
    from hyperbole.el so can be used within hsite.el as well.
  hsite-ex.el (hyperb:stack-frame '(package-install)): The Emacs package
    installer might load this file during package installation before
    hyperbole.el is loaded. Test for this case and allow.
              (hversion): Required.

2016-05-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:package-autoloads-subdirectories-p): Added code to
    ensure Koutliner autoloads in kotl/ subdirectory are generated and
    loaded since these are now generated by the Emacs package system which
    may require a patch to handle subdirectories in patches.  Hyperbole
    automatically applies the patch if need be.
               (hyperb:init): Call this after-init-time so {M-RET} binding
    and others are not overridden.

* Makefile (dist): Removed and replaced with package target.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Added /, = and ? as valid identifier characters.

* Makefile (temp_dir): Removed this directory; used dist_dir instead.
           (dist_hyperbole): Renamed from temp_hyperbole.

* hpath.el (hpath:push-tag-mark): Added xref support.

* kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl:
* man/hyperbole.texi (View Specs): Noted that turning ellipses off may not work in Emac25.

2016-05-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el ((hkey-override-local-bindings, hkey-global-set-key): Added key-description to saved key list
    and fixed the first function to override keys properly.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Autonumbering):
  kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:label-type-alist):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menu-common-body):
  kotl/kview.el (kview:default-label-type, kview:set-label-type): Disabled partial-alpha, start and
    no labeling in outlines since there are likely problems with each and
    no major need for them.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:id-counter): Added and used.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-cell): Conditionalized
    klabel-type:update-labels call to update sibling labels to apply only to
    label-types that require sequential updating.  This eliminated a problem
    when idstamp labels were in use and the counter would increase twice for
    each cell added.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel:idstamp-p): Added and used to prevent
    incrementing idstamp count in multiple places.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:create): Generalized and rewrote the way label
   is generated to account for kview's label-type.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:kill-tree):
  kotl/kfile.el (kfile:create): Called kview:add-cell with parameter of
    "0" rather than "1" so proper label type is generated.
    (kcell-view:create): Updated to handle various label-types.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:increment, klabel:increment-alpha)
    (klabel:increment-partial-alpha, klabel:increment-legal): Changed to
      compute first child of 0 root cell, rather than trigger an error.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:set-label-type): Reset per kview function
    definitions even if the label type doesn't change, as these function
    definitions might have changed.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:function): Removed string formatting of
    idstamp labels as they are already returned as strings.

* kotl/kview.el (hyperb:emacs-p): Optimized to skip to the end of each kcell property

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:child, klabel-type:increment, klabel:level, klabel-type:parent):
    Added support for idstamp and partial-alpha labels.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:end-of-cell): Fixed handling of arg other
    than 1 and noted that this applies only to visible cells.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:level): Deleted save excursion and stopped moving point.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:legal-label): Improved naming and fixed
    where string should have been referenced but index was instead.
    (kotl-label:log26): Deleted and replaced with a direct call of (log n 26).
    (klabel-type:update-tree-labels): Added missing first-label parameter.

* kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menu-common-body): Rearranged movement items so prev
    item of matching item pair always comes first.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Added explicit {C-x i} binding to
   kotl-mode:insert-file since sometimes, e.g. with ido.el loaded, the
   insert-file command is remapped to another command in the global map and
   then the implicit local key binding doesn't happen.
  kotl/kimport (kimport:insert-file): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-file.
               (kimport:insert-file-contents): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-file-contents.
	       (kimport:insert-buffer): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-buffer.
	       (kimport:insert-register): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-register.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:at-p): Fixed issue with missing fall-through
    condition causing <@ 2b1a> style klinks to be missed.

2016-05-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsite-ex.el (find-file-hook): Changed from older find-file-hooks.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:find-file-hook): Removed; unnecessary since file
    reading code has already put point at a valid position before this hook
    was called to do that.  Removal eliminates mutual dependency on
    kotl-mode.el.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Hook Variables):
  hinit.el (hyperb:init):
  DEMO (hyperbole-init-hook): Renamed this variable from hyperb:init-hook.

* hactypes.el (annot-bib): Fixed to not move point in source window.

* hbut.el (ebut:key-src): Tightened search for @loc> button source to only
    look prior to the end of the current line.  Also, changed to ignore
    this source if the explicit button is within a file buffer.  This
    fixed an issue in DEMO where the wrong button source was chosen for an
    explicit button because of a @loc> later in the file.

* dir: Added as part of Hyperbole packaging for adding Hyperbole to the
    Emacs category info directory tree.

* DEMO:
  man/hyperbole.texi:
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Changed all references of Outliner to Koutliner.

* Makefile (version): Added man/version.texi version number check.

* hrmail.el (require): Simplified requires.

* hyperbole.el ("Hyperbole %s is ready for action."): Added version number
    to this message.
               (autoload): Removed duplicative autoloads now loaded from
    hyperbole-autoloads.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (require): Removed kview and kimport; added kfile.
  kotl/kfile.el (require): Removed kotl-mode; added kview.
  kotl/kimport.el (require): Added kotl-mode, allowing removal of more
    duplicative autoloads.


* hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer): Made an autoload since used in hooks.

* Makefile (package): Added this and packageclean targets.  Added remove
    of GNUmakefile.id (not used) in distclean.

2016-05-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:dir): Set from load-file-name if available, e.g.
    when Hyperbole is installed as an Emacs package.

* hyperbole-autoloads.el: Renamed from auto-autoloads.el and added kotl/
    autoloads in here as well.  Require this from hyperbole.el so it can
    redefine some of the autoloads to load more of Hyperbole when called.

* hypb.el (hypb:locate): Added and required locate library.
          (hypb:locate-pathnames): Added.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added Find/Locate-Files.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added Find/LocateFiles.
          (hypb:rgrep): Rewrote so if in the *Locate* output buffer from
    the locate command, then the grep is done on the files listed therein.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-override-local-bindings): Fixed bug that argument is
    a cons pair, allowing for local binding overrides.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-at-delimited-thing-p): Rewrote to handle
    comments whose syntax is marked as punctuation and thus allow the
    action key to select comments.

2016-05-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-select-comment): Added save-excursion in first cond
    predicate so point remains for 2nd conditional.

* hsite-ex.el: (hyperbole-loading): Prevented manual require/load of
    hsite library.  Require/load hyperbole library instead.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:to-visible-position): Updated so when
    backward-p is true, only consider visibility of the character before point.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-initialize): help-mode - match to Lisp symbols with : in
    their names, often included in help buffers.

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p, hargs:iforms-extensions):
  hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): Removed old reference to Info-directory.
  (hargs:iforms-extensions): When reading a kcell label, match only to
  presently visible cells.

* hargs.el (hargs:read-match): Generalized doc string and if input is
    empty, return the default `initial-input' value instead.
  kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:visible-label): Added and used in hargs:read-match.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:get-cells-status): Added missing (goto-char start).

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:demote-tree, kotl-mode:promote-tree):
  kotl/kview.el (kview:map-siblings, kview:map-expanded-tree, kview:map-tree):
    Called kotl-mode:to-start-of-line to handle edge case when a tree is
    collapsed, its branches hidden and point is after the hidden branches.
    Otherwise, the visible tree is missed.  Also ensured point ends up
    back in the same cell where it started.
    (kotl-mode:move-before, kotl-mode:move-after): Removed unused `orig' marker.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:start-of-line): Renamed to kotl-mode:to-start-of-line
    to clarify that it moves point.
                    (kotl-mode:just-one-space): Fixed point movement issue
    when point is within hidden text.

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:initialize): Updated to use unless.
                 (kvspec:lines-to-show): Fixed to not alter which cells
  are visible; this in turn fixed display in kotl-mode:top-cells.

* hui-select.el: Removed all calls to with-syntax-table since there is no
    one table that works for all modes.  Better to simply modify each mode
    as needed for selection.
    (hui-select-thing): Solved problem where punctuation would not select
a region, so the region would never grow.  Now selects the word after point.
    (hui-select-punctuation): Fixed to select properly.
    (hui-select-initialize): Made . a symbol constituent in html and web
      modes so can select a series of object references like parent.child.subchild.

2016-05-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-select-markup-modes, hui-select-initialize): Added
    support for web-mode (multiple language mode for HTML buffers).  Also
    bound {C-c .} for moving between matching tags in web-mode.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-javascript-at-tag-p): Rewrote for much tighter matching.
                (smart-javascript-keywords): Added to ignore keywords as identifier matches.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added missing . after smart-javascript-at-tag-p test.

* hyperbole.el (smart-javascript): Added missing autoload.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:at-p): Conditionalized smart-c-include-regexp to
    match only when in a C-based major mode, avoiding false hits in
    hmtl-mode, for example.

* wrolo-menu.el (wrolo-menubar-menu):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options):
  hinit.el (hyperb:init-menubar):
  hui-menu.el (hyperbole-menubar-menu): Fixed so current-menubar is not
    referenced under GNU Emacs and improved readability.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Added [backtab] (Shift-TAB) binding
    to promote a tree (used to only be M-TAB but many outliners use
    Shift-TAB.

* hyperbole.el (wconfig-ring-empty-p): Added missing autoload for this
    which is referenced in the Hyperbole menubar menu.

* hversion.el (hyperb:mouse-buttons): Changed so Windows default is 3
    mouse buttons as many mice now have 3 buttons or can emulate 3 buttons.

* hsite-ex.el (htz:local): Hyperbole now automatically sets the timezone
    under Windows; manual modifications are no longer necessary.  Added
    conditionalized (require 'htz) here.
  htz.el (htz:local): Modified for MS Windows which returns things like
    "Eastern Daylight Time", so abbreviate to the first letter of each
    word for matching to htz:world-timezones.

2016-05-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:collapse-tree, kotl-mode:expand-tree):
   Fixed to not expand hidden cell when given the all-flag.
                    (kotl-mode:hide-subtree): Fixed to handle when point
   is in a hidden part of the tree.
                    (kotl-mode:move-after, kotl-mode:move-before): Changed
   to leave point at the start of the root of the moved or copied text, so
   user can see and further manipulate this text.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:get-cells-status, kview:set-cells-status, kcell-view:lines-visible,
    kcell-view:next-invisible-p, kview:map-expanded-tree):
      Added these functions and used in kview:map-* functions to restore
      cell view status after manipulation.
                (kview:move):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-tree, kotl-mode:fill-cell): Rewrote to
      utilize above new functions and to greatly improve maintaining the
      same view when some cells are collapsed and invisible.

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:show-lines-this-cell): Added and used.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:map-branch, kview:map-siblings, kview:map-tree):
    Added a second save-excursion to eliminate movement within the kview
    if the kview is not within the current buffer.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-cell): Changed to call
    kcell-view:collapsed-p.
    (kotl-mode:fill-tree): Fixed bug that did not expand whole tree for filling.

* wconfig.el (wconfig-set-window-configuration): Added and used throughout
    to handle bad wconfig entries.

* hinit.el (hyperb:init-menubar): Fixed to add Hyperbole to the menubar
    after emacs initializations are run.

2016-05-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:show-lines-per-cell): Simplified to first show
    all lines in all cells.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:delete-indentation): Slightly improved doc.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:char-visible-p, kview:first-invisible-point): Added.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:shrink-region, kotl-mode:valid-region-p,
    kotl-mode:maybe-shrink-region-p):
      Added these new functions and used the last one at the start of each
      kotl-mode editing command to trigger an error if the region spans more
      than one cell, e.g. after a mouse drag.
    (kotl-mode:indent-region): Called last above function.
    (kotl-mode:shrink-region-flag): Added with default value of nil.
       When enabled, automatically shrinks the region to within a single cell
       before edit commands.
    (delete-selection-pre-hook): Overrode this function from delsel.el to
       possibly auto-shrink the region.
    (kotl-mode:*): Added mode-specific support for delete-selection-mode from delsel library.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added entries for Tramp and remote pathname.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:create): Added (kview:is-p) test in case kview
    exists already.  This may eliminate a sporadic issue where a kview
    data structure becomes invalid.

* hui-mini.el (hyperbole):
  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Removed (require 'hsite) since the
    hyperbole.el file now takes care of this.

    and restored conditional adding of kotl/ directory.
  hinit.el (hui-menu-remove): Made this an autoload and moved from hyperbole.el.

* hypb.el (hypb:debug):
  hyperbole.el (autoload): Changed all to load "hyperbole" rather than "hsite".
               (hypb:chmod): Changed from (function) to #'.

  hactypes.el (link-to-rfc): Generalized doc.
  hsys-w3.el (www-url-find-file-noselect): Generalized.

               (hpath:remote-regexp): Renamed from hyperb:efs-path-and-url-regexp.
               (hpath:handle-urls): Renamed from hyperb:handle-urls.
    Rewrote to generalize and support Tramp.
    Moved all hpath:* functions and variables from here to hpath.el.
  hpath.el (hpath:enable-find-file-urls, hpath:disable-find-file-urls): Rewrote to use Tramp.
           (hpath:efs-*): Renamed all to hpath:remote-*.
           (hpath:remote-default-user, hpath:remote-available-p): Added newer
    Tramp library support and changed to return the symbol for the package to use.

* hib-doc-id.el: Updated documentation and removed site-specific code.

==============================================================================
V5.10 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* hyperbole.el (hsite): Added code to automatically install hsite.el and
    to warn if hsite-ex.el is newer.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added InfoDock and the OO-Browser definitions.

* hyperbole.el: Moved complete hyperb:dir setup here from hversion.el.
    Moved Hyperbole initialization here from hsite-ex.el.  Changed so this
    file requires hsite rather than vice-versa, allowing for single file
    loading and initialization of Hyperbole, including adding it to the
    load-path.  Do not separately require or load hsite anymore.

2016-05-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

*  man/hyperbole.texi (Koutliner Keys):
   kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl:
   kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:overview, kotl-mode:show-all, kotl-mode:top-cells): Added
     optional prefix arg to toggle display of blank lines viewspec.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-outline-subtree-hidden-p): Fixed to not move point.

* hyperbole.el (hui-menu-remove): Deleted support for older XEmacs versions.

* Removed (function) quote from all lambda calls; lambda is self-quoting now.
  Removed #' quoting from lambdas; any current emacs version should support this.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:backward-word, kotl-mode:forward-char, kotl-mode:forward-word):
    Updated to use some new primitives.
                    (kotl-mode:hide-tree): Added kotl-mode:start-of-line to ensure whole

    which was duplicated in the subcall to kvspec:levels-to-show.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:tree-end): Fixed to go to end of current
    cell when at the end of the tree and used in kotl-mode:mail-tree.

2016-05-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:label-type-alist): Changed 'idstamp' to 'id' to
    properly match label-type value.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:move): Ensured collapsed cells list is created
    before the cells are moved, since insert may not retain collapsed
    properties.
                (kcell-view:collapse):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:collapse-tree): Fixed to leave first line of cell visible.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Added call to kotl-mode:show-all prior to
    any change of major mode in a koutline buffer.  Also, made more
    variables buffer-local.

    of the visible line and renamed to kot-mode:to-end-of-line.
    (kotl-mode:set-temp-goal-column):
    (kotl-mode:eocp): Changed to call kotl-mode:eolp and rewrote that
    function to handle invisible newlines.
    (kotl-mode): Set track-eol to t for better end-of-line vertical movement.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Moved link to outline match to 2nd
    lowest priority, so that a link to file or directory is the default.
    Deleted link to elisp possibility as it can embed long elisp functions in
    the button data file and possibly not parse them correctly.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:line-move): Accounted for
   temporary-goal-column potentially being a cons.
   (kotl-mode:previous-line, kotl-mode:next-line): Unified begin and end

                     kotl-mode:hide-subtree, kotl-mode:show-all, kotl-mode:hide-tree,
                     kotl-mode:fill-cell): Rewrote to use only outline-*
    functions, e.g. changed subst-char-in-region call to outline-flag-region.
                    (kotl-mode): Added line-move-ignore-invisible true
    setting and call to add-to-invisibility-spec.
                    (kotl-mode:line-move): Changed to boolean test of

    macro, defined in hyperbole.el

* kotl/kfile.el: Changed to always require kmenu since menubars exist on dumb terminals now.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added support for xref item lists.  Action
    Key displays an xref file line or just a file containing an xref.
    Assist Key displays the same but leaves point in the listing buffer.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Fixed to expand relative file names in Hyperbole
    buttons to absolute paths based on the source directory of the button,
    e.g. when referencing a global button from a buffer in a directory
    different than the source directory.

* wrolo-menu.el (wrolo): Added (require 'wrolo).
  wrolo.el (wrolo-mode): Removed (require 'wrolo-menu).  Reversed who

    button priority so that files and pathnames don't trigger as implicit
    buttons.
               (smart-dired): Changed last line quit handler to skip
    marked deletions and just quit dired.  To execute marked deletions,
    press the Action Key on the first line of the buffer (the dired
    directory name).

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:overview): Respect the blank-line viewspec,
    so the user can control it.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keyboard Keys):
  hui-mouse.el (smart-gnus-group, smart-gnus-group-assist): If
    `gnus-topic-mode' is active, and on a topic line, the topic is
     expanded or collapsed as needed.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keyboard Keys):
  hui-mouse.el (action-key-default-function): Added comment about setting
    it to #'hyperbole to bring up the Hyperbole minibuffer menu.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hypb.el (hypb:remove-lines, hypb:save-lines): Added and used in menus,

  hui-mouse.el:
  wrolo-menu.el (wrolo-menu-common-body):
  hyperbole.el (outline-*): Added aliases to new outline-* functions for older
    emacs versions.
  wrolo.el: Called new outline-* functions.

* wrolo-menu.el:
  kotl/kmenu.el:
  hinit.el (hyperb:init-menubar): Eliminated hyperb:window-system test
    since menubars now work on dumb terminals.
           (hui-menu): Added missing require of this library.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key): Added to save global key bindings
    which Hyperbole overrides.  Used in hkey-initialize.
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-set-key-list): Use hkey-global-set-key.

* hmouse-key.el (action-key-depress, assist-key-depress,
    assist-key-depress-emacs19, action-mouse-key-emacs19): Removed
    (require 'hsite) since autoloads handle this.
    (action-mouse-key-emacs19, assist-mouse-key-emacs19): Added apply call
       to remove extra list layer here, rather than later.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Updated.

   bindings are always on shift buttons now and rewrote.
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
* hmouse-reg.el (hmouse-get-bindings): Removed NEXTSTEP unshifted mouse
    key bindings, just use shifted ones on a 2-button mouse.  Also renamed
    to hmouse-get-unshifted-bindings.
                (hmouse-setup): Renamed to hmouse-unshifted-setup.
                (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Changed mouse key bindings so
    mouse-3 is never bound to the Assist Key; now it can be used for popup
    menus.  This binds only mouse-2 to the Action Key.
  hmouse-reg.el: Removed this file and merged into hmouse-sh.el.

2016-05-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* wconfig.el (ring): Used ring.el to provide frame-specific, named window
     configurations and frame-specific window configuration rings.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Window Configurations): Updated documentation.

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term):
  hui-em19-b.el (hproperty:color-list, hproperty:good-colors): Added check
    for a window-system of gtk.

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Fixed installation of
    hkey-override-local-bindings when hyperbole.el has already been loaded.

          (hbut:comment): Don't add comments in messaging-related buffers
    even though they have comment syntax.

* hmail.el (hmail:composer): Changed default from mail-mode to
    message-mode, the newer setting for Emacs.

* h-skip-bytec.lsp (hmouse-set-point): Deleted this file and moved this
    function to hmouse-key.el since the issue that kept us from
    byte-compiling this function under X must be fixed by now.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-help): Prevented error message when window cannot
    be shrunk.
              (hyperbole): Updated documentation.

2016-05-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

                (hmouse-yank-region):  Moved point to one end of the region
    that hkey-value stores.
                (hmouse-drag-region-active, hmouse-drag-not-allowed,
                 hmouse-goto-region-point): Added to handle the case
    where a region is active prior to a Smart Key drag; trigger an error.
  man/hkey-help.txt:
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Keys): Updated doc with these changes.

2016-05-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu): Add the menu before the OO-Browser
    menu, if on the menubar.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-setup): Disabled kmacro-call-mouse-event which can
   create a global mouse key binding to [S-mouse-3] that conflicts with the
   Assist Mouse Key.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Creating Outlines):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  DEMO: Renamed the Hyperbole Koutliner menus so they all start with K for
    consistency.  So now with the mini-buffer menu, type 'k' rather than
    'o' to utilize the Koutliner.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Find>GrepFiles
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Find/Grep-Files
  hypb.el (hypb:rgrep, hypb:rgrep-command): Added this command as an
    autoload and used in Hyperbole menus, replacing standard grep command
    for a much more effective grep.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-find-p, smart-tags-display): Fixed bug that
    overrode value of non-nil tags-table-list, sometimes preventing the
    Smart Key from showing a tag definition.

* hypb.el (hypb:configuration): Now adds the (HyDebug) entries from the
     Messages* buffer when composing a message to bug-hyperbole.

* hargs.el (hargs:completion): Generalized buffer-name match to include
    package-specific completions like *Ido Completions*" or any buffer
    in completion-mode.

* hypb.el (hypb:window-list): Simplified to use window-list which should
    be consistent across emacs variants now.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Removed set-buffer call because the
    displayed buffer has already been selected. Don't use help-mode in
    buffers already set up with a quit-key to bury the buffer,
    e.g. minibuffer completions, as this will sometimes disable default
    left mouse key item selection.
  hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer, hpath:display-buffer)
           (hpath:display-buffer-other-frame): Changed to return selected
    window and updated doc.; this fixed a completions failure in hkey-help-show
    used in temp-buffer-show-hook.

* man/hkey-help.txt: Unified horizontal and vertical drag actions,
    regardless of drag direction (left or right; up or down).  Action Key
    splits the current window and Assist Key deletes it.

  hui-window.el (hmouse-split-window-horizontally): Renamed to hmouse-vertical-action-drag;
    removed window-min-width setting.
                (hmouse-split-window-vertically): Renamed to hmouse-horizontal-action-drag
    and used in horizontal drag action; removed window-min-height setting.
                (hmouse-vertical-assist-drag):
                (hmouse-horizontal-assist): Renamed to hmouse-horizontal-assist-drag.
		(hmouse-horizontal): Delted.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================

2016-04-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Added call to hpath:display-buffer so
    buffer is shown according to user custom settings.

* hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer): Removed call to hpath:push-tag-mark.
    It may be interferring with region selection/manipulation via Smart
    Key drags.

2016-04-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Prefer newer write-file-functions variable.
    Moved Hyperbole key bindings and local key override initialization
    here and made them run after the editor is fully initialized.

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term):
  hui-window.el (hmouse-split-window-horizontally, hmouse-split-window-vertically):
    Changed function prefix from 'sm-'.
                (hyperb:window-system): Changed to a defvar.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-toggle-debug): Added.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Customize/Toggle-Smart-Key-Debug.

  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-execute): Added flag hkey-debug and hkey-debug
    function to show the context and values from each Smart Key activation.

* hui-mouse.el (require 'hbut): Added so don't have to conditionalize (hbut:at-p) call.
               (hkey-alist): Simplified hbut:at-p predicate and stored it result
   for debugging purposes.  Removed separate call to hbut:label-p since hbut:at-p
   calls it.
* hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize): Added this function and moved all
    Hyperbole key bindings here.  Added it to after-init-hook so
    Hyperbole key bindings are added only after Emacs is initialized,
    allowing them to override defaults where necessary, notably with mouse
    keys.

* hmouse-drv.el (action-mouse-key, assist-mouse-key): Added clear of hkey-value.

* Makefile (dist): Removed copying of hkey-help.txt from $(data_dir_dist)
    into distribution since this might be an old copy.  Remove
    data_dir_dist variable since no longer used.

* hypb.el (hypb:configuration): Small text improvements.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keyboard Keys): Improved doc for unrecognized contexts.

* man/hkey-help.txt: Corrected that by default, an invalid context
   produces an error message rather than bringing up the Hyperbole
   minibuffer menu.

* MANIFEST:
  Makefile (TEXI2HTML): Changed to use standard makeinfo --html.
           (HTML_MANUALS): Removed.  Added html format of the manual to
the distribution.
           (ps): Updated dir variable names.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Added check of newer Emacs variable
    help-window-select.

* hypb.el (hypb:push-mark): Deleted this old definition as all current
    Emacs versions have push-mark now.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Tighted match to ignore all
    punctuation matches such as, ***.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-goto-matching-delimiter):
  hyperbole.el ({C-c .}): Added this global binding to jump between the
    opening and closing delimiters of a delimited thing, e.g. a string.
    Also, works on matching markup tag pairs in HTML and SGML modes.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key, *hkey-list*): Added to capture global
    Hyperbole key sequences for possible unsetting in local modes.
               (hkey-override-local-bindings): Unset local keys here.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-get-bindings, hmouse-setup):
  hmouse-reg.el (hmouse-get-bindings, hmouse-setup): Trigger NEXTSTEP setup
    only when window-system is 'dps, not 'ns which Mac OS X uses too.
    Fixes issue with binding the Action Key to mouse-1 instead of mouse-2
    under Emacs on Mac OS X.

2016-04-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb.el (hypb:mouse-help-file): Renamed to hypb:hkey-help-file.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-init): Changed doc to lookup keybindings.

* hmouse-drv.el (help-window-point-marker): Added conditional definition
    of this help variable not provided in earlier Emacs versions but
    referenced in an Emacs 25 compiled version of `with-help-buffer' used
    in `hkey-help-show'.  Fixes error with display of completions.
                (hkey-help-show): Nullified `temp-buffer-show-hook'
    and `temp-buffer-show-function' in here to prevent recursive call of
    help-mode when it calls with-temp-buffer.  This fixed error in display
    of apropos and other help information.
                (action-key, assist-key): Updated documentation.

* hyperbole.el (after-load-alist): Fixed quoting for this hook.

2016-04-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* h-skip-bytec.lsp (hmouse-set-point): Fixed to handle when called with no
    args from hkey-operate (keyboard drag emulation).

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-operate): Made prefix arg flag optional.

* HY-ABOUT: Added Hyperbole version number.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Renamed from Smart Key Assignments
    and changed some descriptions of the bindings.

* hactypes.el (link-to-elisp-doc): Added support for variables.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added support for Emacs push buttons.  Action
    key activates a button at point and Assist Key shows help for it.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-known-identifier-p, smart-tags-find-p): Added
    for testing whether a potential Lisp identifier is found in any tags file.

* hibtypes.el (texinfo-ref): Added support to display Texinfo nodes
    references within Texinfo node names and menu items.  Also to show
    documentation for Emacs Lisp identifiers within @code{} and @var()
    references.
  hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Since code references are
    handled within texinfo-ref now, removed texinfo-mode from matching here.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons):
  man/hkey-help.txt: Updated doc with these changes.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist):
  hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Moved test for help-mode to here from hkey-alist.

2016-04-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Tightened match for in-file HTML references to
    avoid matching to Lisp #'function constructs.

* hui-mouse.el:

==============================================================================
V5.08 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* hui.el (hui:hbut-act, hui:hbut-current-act):
  hinit.el (hyperb:act-set): Removed this and hyperb:act and hcoord: references, since
    coordinated/group browsing was never implemented.

* hbut.el (gbut:act): Added error handling for a null or empty string label input.

* hpath.el (hpath:find-program, hpath:find-file-mailcap): Improved doc and
    added fallback use of mailcap external program viewer settings
    (mailcap code from Mats Lidell <matsl@contactor.se>).
  HY-NEWS:
  man/hyperbole.texi (External Viewers): Documented this change.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired-assist): Call dired-unmark-all-files.

2016-04-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmail.el (hmail:invoke): Simplified by using compose-mail.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Prefer call to find-tag-noselect
    (newer etags.el) than find-tag-internal.

* man/hyperbole.texi:
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Renamed Customization menu to Customize.

* hyperbole.el (hmouse-shift-buttons): Bind Hyperbole mouse buttons only
      when hkey-init is true (the default).
     Removed compatibility functions for many years old emacs versions:
       frame function aliases,
       find-file-noselect overload and hyperb:find-file-noselect.
       (substitute-in-file-name): Made string-match tighter.
       (hkey-read-only-bindings): Removed local assist-key bindings which
     just shadow the same existing global binding, now that we can
     automatically eliminate local bindings that shadow the global
     Hyperbole Smart Keys.  Also simplified function.
     Removed PIEmail pm-hook; this package no longer exists.
       (assist-key-read-only): Removed, no longer used.
       (hkey-init): Made this an autoload.  Changed so no keys are bound herein
     unless this is true (previously, this affected only the Smart
     Keys). Reordered key bindings to emphasize Smart Keys.

* hyperbole (hkey-override-local-bindings, hkey-install-override-local-bindings,
     hkey-toggle-override-local-bindings):
     (hkey-init-override-local-keys): Added this new feature which allows for

  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Toggle-Override-Local-Keys.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Simplified Toggle-Rolo-Dates and added Override-Local-Key.

* hui.el (hui:hbut-help): Fixed bug where :help was bound as a symbol but

    symbol is a function to call.
         (ebut:list): Called apply on set:create to fix list nesting bug.
         (hbut:report): Called with-help-window and nullified
   temp-buffer-show-{hook,function} to prevent a nested call to
   with-output-to-temp-buf that would erase the help buffer after data.

2016-04-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp): Simplified documentation.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-man-c-routine-ref): Improved and fixed documentation.

* hibtypes.el (text-toc): Fixed to match documentation.

* hyperbole.el (vm-mode-hook): Renamed to this newer name.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus):
  hui.el (hui:bind-key): Added.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Change-Key-Bindings menu and made
    Customization option settings into submenus as the single-level menu was
    getting too long.

    interactive rebinding of each global Hyperbole key.

* hgnus.el: (require 'gnus-msg): Added and removed old gnuspost.el loading.

* hargs.el (hargs:set-string-to-complete): Fixed bug that included
    minibuffer prompt in string; changed 'buffer-string' call to
    'minibuffer-contents'.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added Hyperbole Demonstration to
    the top-level menubar so it is easy for new users to find.

* hhist.el (all): Greatly improved to use frame configurations rather than just
    storing a point in a buffer.
 (hhist:wind-line): Deleted, unused.

* DEMO (By Dragging): Info node was improperly referenced with earlier name, 'Drags'.
    Made a number of small updates in this file.

* hypb.el (hypb:hyperbole-banner-keymap):
          (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Reworked to allow graphic in hyperb:dir.
    Refactored to support GNU Emacs.  Use 'help-mode' as major mode for
    easier navigaton and window restore.

* hpath.el (hpath:url-regexp2): Made : optional again so www.gnu.org works
    as a URL.

* Makefile (distclean): Remove any TODO* working files from the dist.
    Other small changes.

2016-04-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

                (kotl-popup-menu):

       Emacs has popup-menu now.

  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu):

    properly with Emacs menubars.
              (hui-menu-remove): Remove Koutline menu as well.

* Makefile: Added the following files as distribution dependency checks:
      auto-autoloads.el, DEMO, MANIFEST, _hypb, .hypb, _pkg.el,
      ChangeLog (only the latest one), hyperbole-banner.png, hypb-mouse.txt,
      file-newer, smart-clib-sym
    Changed distribution so only recent year ChangeLog is included, as the
    rest is very old and irrelevant now.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Use help-mode major mode for Hyperbole Help buffers.
   This generally allows typing q to quit and restore the prior window configuration.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus): Added new Find menu documentation.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added new Find menu to find matches and
    non-matches of regexps across buffers and files.
    Removed HypbCopy item which duplicated Info item.
       Removed MsgForums since this manual section is gone and spread elsewhere.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added new Find menu to find matches and
    non-matches of regexps across buffers and files.

==============================================================================

2016-04-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* MANIFEST:
  Makefile (EL_KOTL, ELC_KOTL): Added "kexport" file which had been
    mistakenly left out of distribution build dependencies.

2016-04-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:scroll-down, kotl-mode:scroll-up): Modified
    to work as global key bindings for use with mouse wheel scroll variables.

* hmail.el (hmail:invoke): Modernized to use mail-user-agent settings.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hibtypes.el (hyp-address):
  hactypes.el (hyp-request): Updated mail list information and extended menus.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:maintain-region-highlight): Removed
    window-system conditional for transient-mark-mode since it now works on
    dumb terminals.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:view): Added missing file-name parameter to second
    'error' call.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:find-file-hook):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:find-file-hook): Renamed to
    kfile:find-file-hook and moved to "kfile.el" to ensure that kfile is
    loaded (which loads kotl-mode) if this is invoked at startup, e.g. when
    desktop restores a file.  Left an alias to kotl-mode-find-file-hook
    for backward compatibility.

* Removed support for old, no longer used Apollo window system.

* hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer-alist, hpath:display-where-alist): Hash
    quoted functions for byte-compilation.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-indent-to-region): Rewrote with 'replace-match' call.

* MANIFEST: Corrected to reference kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl

* kotl/kfile.el:
  kotl/kotl.el: Improved naming: renamed this file to kcell.el to better represent it and
   renamed the 'kotl-data' structure to 'kcell-data'.

* hargs.el (hargs:iform-read): Added support for Emacs interactive '^'
   prefix character for activating/deactivating the transient region via
   shift selection.

2016-04-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Overloaded left-char and right-char for
  Emacs arrow keys.

* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html): Replaced 'insert-string' with 'princ' since it works
    differently in GNU Emacs and would fail to export cell contents.
    (kexport:html): Updated doc string and added optional prefix arg,
    SOFT-NEWLINES-P to prevent hard newline breaks within cells.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:example): Rewrote so always uses the
    distribution EXAMPLE.kotl file rather than the personally saved and
    edited one, if the distribution file is newer.  In that case,
    save a copy of the personal one, as SAVED-EXAMPLE.kotl before replacing it.
    (kotl-mode:backward-or-forward-delete-char): Added GNU Emacs support.
    (kotl-mode-map): Added delete-forward-char.
    (kotl-mode:delete-char): Improved beginning and end of cell testing,
    fixing issues when prefix arguments are given.

* hvm.el: VM is not available as a regular Emacs package, so it is somewhat
    difficult to install properly.  Requiring it below will therefore
    often trigger an error and prevent Hyperbole from properly
    building, so prevent this error with a condition-case around this
    whole file.

* man/hyperbole.texi: Updated version, copyrights, URL handling documentation.

* hsys-w3.el (www-url): Changed to use browse-url.el support of textual
    browsers when not running under a window system.  Removed w3 library
    dependencies.

	  (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Rewrote to do nothing if banner file is not found.

2016-04-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>
* hpath.el (hpath:find-line): Replaced goto-line call since it is meant for interactive use.

* set.el (set:remove): Fixed bug by removing extra set of parentheses around args in call to 'set:member'.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Conditionalized "%_" XEmacs menu
    accelerator key prefix, so it does not appear as a literal in the Hyperbole menu name under GNU Emacs.

2016-04-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* set.el (set:create): Improved to allow collection types as set elements.

* set.el (set:difference): Fixed boundary case error by adding (setq rtn-set ...)

  hmouse-tag.el: Added support for JavaScript identifier definition location.

2014-08-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>
