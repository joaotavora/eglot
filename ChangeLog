	event by adding a `redisplay' call just before the `post-move' emision.
	(chess-display-select-piece): Use `chess-display-draw-square'.
	(chess-display-draw-square): Make PIECE argument optional.
	(chess-display-mode-map): Bind DEL to `chess-input-shortcut-delete'

	(chess-test-database): More descriptive name.
	(chess-perft): Require as this is our entry-point for testing.

	(chess-algebraic-regexp, chess-algebraic-to-ply): Handle figurine
	notation.

2014-06-13  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	generate figurine notation.
	* chess-var.el (chess-var-add-ply): Fix docstring.
	(chess-var-to-algebraic): Adjust argument names.
	* doc/chess.texi (Making a move in a variation): Same here.

	* chess-ics.el (chess-ics): Add custom-manual link.

	* chess-plain.el (chess-plain): Add custom-manual link.

2005-06-27  John Wiegley  <johnw@newartisans.com>

	* chess-ics.el (chess-ics-sought-add): Added this routine to
	factor out a lot of duplicated code.

	* chess-plain.el (chess-plain-popup): Pass nil for the `font'
	argument to `chess-display-popup-in-frame', since we don't care
	what the size of the font is with textual chessboards.

	* chess-input.el (chess-input-shortcut): If a character is typed
	that is not a legal start of a move (which only happens if it's
	not bound to anything else), just ignore it.

	* chess-images.el (chess-images-determine-size): On Macs and
	Windows, reduce the screen height by 80 instead of just 20, to
	account for the Start/Status bar.
	(chess-images-popup): Pass in a `font' to
	`chess-display-popup-in-frame', so that the pixel height for each
	graphical piece is computed correctly.
	(chess-images-change-size): Foricbly popup the chess buffer when
	changing the size of graphical pieces.

	* chess-ics1.el (chess-ics1-popup): Added `font' argument in call
	to `chess-display-popup-in-frame'.

	* chess-display.el (chess-display-popup-in-frame): Added a `font'
	parameter, so that the font can be set in new chessboard
	frames (which is necessary to get the pixel height/width right).

2004-12-07  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-algebraic.el, chess-announce.el, chess-autosave.el,
	  chess-common.el, chess-display.el:

	bug in pgn font-locking (Klaus Straubinger <KSNetz@Arcor.DE>)

2004-04-12  jwiegley  <jwiegley@lexx>

	* PLAN: chess-pos - typing a number in a chessboard display gets
	an assertion

2004-03-08  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-pgn.el: bah, recursive loading...chess-pgn.el

2004-03-06  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* README: Rephrase the intro, and add a HISTORY section
	to document the maintainership change.

	* PLAN: Remove chess-input entry, which was bogus.

	* chess-pgn.el (chess-pgn-read-game): Fix database-index calculation.
	Now `chess-pgn-show-position' should work as expected in multiple
	game PGN files.

2004-03-01  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ply.el 1.46
	(chess-legal-plies): Add :candidates keyword to avoid calls to
	chess-search-position if the caller already knows the piece indices

	* chess-ai.el 1.8:
	(chess-eval-static): Try to reward passed pawns and piece mobility
	using the new :candidates keyword to chess-legal-plies.

	* chess-maint.el 1.11: put byte-compiling-files-p back in for now.

	* chess-ics.el 1.96: better icc datagram support

2004-02-29  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	chess-ics-icc-preoutput-filter.
	New variable chess-ics-icc-datagrams to define which datagrams should
	be requested upon login.
	New variable chess-ics-server-type which defaults to FICS, and gets set
	to ICC when we encounter an ICC server.
	Handle DG_KIBITZ by translating them to the FICS representation.
	Handle movelist request through DG_POSITION_BEGIN2 and DG_PASTMOVE.

2004-02-25  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-phalanx.el 1.15: Add elisp header and homepage link.

	* chess-phalanx.el 1.14:

	for now.

2004-02-24  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ics.el 1.93: more stability improvements.

2004-02-22  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ai.el 1.7
	(chess-eval-static): Primitive mobility handling, makes play a lot
	more aggressive :)

	* chess-ai.el 1.6: reward passed pawns, and make the code a bit faster

	* chess-ics.el 1.92 (chess-ics-ads-removed):
	We need to be a lot more careful when deleteing stuff on a
	preoutput-filter-function.  Fixed this, which also
	fixes all the remaining cases of missed boards.  LectureBot
	ran through three Lectures without any bug, which seems good!

	* chess-ics.el: Require 'rx when compiling.
	(chess-ics-style12-regexp): New constant regexp which matches
	a style12 string (subgroup 1 to 32).
	(chess-ics-matcher-alist): Use it.
	(chess-ics-matcher-alist): Destroy game object if we see a
	"no longer examining..." message.
	(chess-ics-handle-style12): Rewrite using `match-string' instead of
	`pop' based on the new regexp above.
	(chess-ics-handle-style12): No longer `message' parse errors, rather
	keep the failed board in the buffer, and add the failure info
	to the front of the line.  Makes finding remaining bugs a lot
	easier since the buffer can be reviewed in chronological order.
	(chess-ics-ads-removed): We need to be a lot more careful when
	deleteing stuff on a preoutput-filter-function.  Fixed this, which also
	fixes all the remaining cases of missed boards.  LectureBot
	ran through three Lectures without any bug, which seems good!

2004-02-21  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-engine.el (chess-engine-filter): We were calling `forward-line'
	unconditionally.  However, there is a race condition, namely,
	if the last line does not end with a newline, forward-line
	will skip to eob, therefore, engine regexps will simply
	be missed.  Fixed.
	(chess-engine-entire-lines): This was a fix for the wrong problem,
	removed.

2004-02-18  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-display.el (chess-display-highlight-passed-pawns): New
	interactive function.

	* chess-pos.el (chess-pos-passed-pawns): New function.

2004-02-12  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-phalanx.el (chess-phalanx-handler): Set
	chess-engine-entire-lines t.

	* chess-engine.el (chess-engine-entire-lines): New variable.
	(chess-engine-filter): handle it.

	* chess-ics.el (chess-ics-sought-mode-map): New variable.

2004-02-08  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-crafty.el (chess-crafty-handler): Add search-depth and
	search-time engine options.

2004-02-06  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-display.el (chess-display-paint-move): Handle :en-passant
	captures (remove the captured pawn from the board).

	* chess-puzzle.el (chess-puzzle): Disable autosave.
	(chess-puzzle-show-solution): New function (bound to ? in puzzle
	displays) for showing a solution (if one is known).  This typically
	only works for EPD databases with either bm or pv information.
	Displaying of annotations is not yet done.

2004-02-05  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-file.el:
	Handle .epd and .pgn files in the chess-file module.  Achieved by
	setting a buffer-local variable chess-file-type to either 'pgn or 'epd
	on 'open, and use this info to dispatch correctly.
	This change makes it possible to load .epd files with the
	chess-puzzle function for instance.

	* chess-fen.el (chess-fen-regexp): New constant.

	* chess-epd.el (chess-game-to-epd): New defsubst to convert a game
	object to an EPD string (or insert it).
	(chess-epd-to-game): Analogous to the above.
	(chess-epd-parse): Use `chess-fen-regexp'.

2004-02-03  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-tutorial.el (chess-tutorial): Simplify and add autoload.

	* chess-announce.el (chess-announce-handler): On event 'kibitz, talk.

	* chess-ics.el (chess-ics-initial-commands): New defcustom to make
	the init-strings sent after login configurable.
	(chess-ics-movelist-start-position): New buffer-local variable
	which defaults to `chess-starting-position'.  Its value (if non-nil)
	is used to initialize the board when seeing a movelist header.
	This is to allow for servers which have the equivalent of
	"iset startpos 1" on FICS, which tells the server to automatically
	send the initial position before sending a movelist.  This is
	to allow non-standard starting positions, and still maintain
	complete game information in the game object locally.
	(chess-ics-matcher-alist): If we see something like "startpos set",
	we set chess-ics-movelist-start-position to nil.
	(chess-ics-handle-style12): Renamed from chess-ics-handle-ics12.
	Set game-data 'black-moved-first to t if we see a initial board
	(move is "none"), and side-to-move is Black.  Use this information
	to calculate the correct game index from the supplied game sequence.
	This fixes observing of arbitrary start position games where
	Black moved first. (Most of LectureBot should work now).
	(chess-ics-seeking): Handle "set ptime 1" prompts.
	(chess-ics-ads-removed): Ditto.

2004-01-28  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ply.el 1.45
	(chess-ply-castling-changes): When doing a long castle, only check if
	the king can move to the d or c file without being in check.  According
	to the crafty-list, it is legal to do a long castle if some opponent
	piece is attacking the b file.

	* chess-ics.el 1.82
	(chess-ics-matcher-alist): Send "set interface emacs-chess VERSION"
	on init.

	* chess.el 1.67:
	Temporarily disable the condition-case in the main startup function,
	some strange engine errors are caught and hard to debug with this,
	also add chess-opening and chess-ai to the default modules.

	* chess-pos.el 1.46
	(chess-search-position): Document arguments CHECK-ONLY and NO-CASTLING.

	* chess-engine.el 1.99:

	(chess-display-create): More docs.

	* chess-var.el 1.10: docfixes

	* chess.texi 1.22: Proofread fixes.

2004-01-27  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-fen.el 1.13: Commentary synced with reality of FEN standard.

	* README 1.4: chess-ai is a submodule of chess-common.

	* chess-ply.el 1.44: docfix.

	* chess-gnuchess.el 1.35
	(chess-gnuchess-path): Add *, since this is a user-option.

	* chess-opening.el 1.3: uncomment the remaining failure cases,
	chess-algebraic handles those now.

	* chess-opening.el 1.2:	We now have the individual moves in the source
	file, and get the final position at compile time.

	* chess-tutorial.el 1.4: We can use `chess-display-set-from-fen' here.

	* chess-maint.el 1.8, chess.texi 1.21: Add in minimal docs for FEN
	notation, algebraic notation, and ICS.

2004-01-26  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-pos.el 1.45
	(chess-pos-move): Fix  a bug in castling removal when the Rook
	is moved, now compare chess-pos-can-castle and the source square of
	the moving piece to figure out if we need to remove castling
	priviledges.

	* chess-pos.el 1.44
	(chess-pos-legal-candidates): remove the opponent pawn if we are
	capturing en passant.
	this fixes a bug where chess-legal-plies does not find an en passant
	move if the pawn to be captured is giving check.

	* chess-database.el 1.12, chess-file.el 1.7, chess-scid.el 1.7:
	new function chess-database-filename, also support it in scid and
	file DBs.

2004-01-25  John Wiegley  <jwiegley@lexx>

	* chess-algebraic.el 1.35, chess-pos.el 1.43
	(chess-search-position): Added an argument so that if we are
	searching for the source of an algebraic move, and it is not a castle,
	then do not check castle moves.

2004-01-23  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-database.el 1.11
	(chess-database-query): use `apply'.

	* chess-scid.el 1.6
	(chess-scid-handler): Support query tree-search.

	* chess-engine.el 1.98:	Don't barf on unbound
	chess-module-regexp-alist, and add some docstrings.

	* chess-game.el 1.59: Docstring fixes + a redo of chess-game-seq.

	* chess-pgn.el 1.40: Fixes to make chess-scid read parsing work.

2004-01-21  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-opening.el 1.1:	Opening classification module based on the
	scid.eco file from scid 3.5.

2004-01-20  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-fen.el 1.12: FEN notation actually specifies that field
	four (en passant) should denote the target square of the immenent
	capture, not the square of the piece about to be taken.

	* chess-ics.el 1.81: Catch manually typed "resign" and fix a bug
	where only one game could be played for each session.

	* chess-fen.el 1.11
	(chess-pos-to-fen): Don't emit a trailing / on rank 8.

2004-01-19  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ics.el 1.80: tidying

	* chess-epd.el 1.6: minor change.

	* chess-ics.el 1.79: Rewrite this module such that it does not act
	as an engine, rather it invokes chess-sessions as needed.  You need
	to use M-x chess-ics RET instead of C-u M-x chess RET ics RET now.
	(chess-ics-handle-ics12): Rewrite such that it can handle the "refresh"
	command, and moves entered manually in the ICS buffer.

2004-01-16  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ai.el 1.5:
	We no longer need to dedvar chess-ai-regexp-alist with
	a nil value.

	* chess-engine.el 1.97 (chess-engine-create): Use `insern-soft'
	instead of `intern' to copy the engine-regexp-alist.

2004-01-15  John Wiegley  <jwiegley@lexx>

	* chess.texi 1.20: Adding description of the module system.

2004-01-14  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-sjeng.el 1.2: Elisp header + homepage link.

	* chess-sjeng.el 1.1: Module for the sjeng engine (promotion still
	doesn't work.)

	* chess-algebraic.el 1.34
	(chess-algebraic-to-ply): `let'-bind case-fold-search nil. This fixes
	a bug where b8c6 is parsed to c7-c6.

2004-01-13  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ics.el 1.78: Initial skeleton for Game Creating messages.
	Support relation-type -2 (Examining game).
	Handle the 'forward event.
	(Now you can use the "examine" command on FICS, and simply
	 type '.' in the ChessBoard display to forward through the game.)

	* chess-display.el 1.118
	(chess-display-set-index): If INDEX is greater than chess-game-index,
	and the last ply is not final, we emit a 'forward chess-module-game
	event to give ics a chance to issue "forward\n". This makes
	'.' work as expected in examined games.

2004-01-12  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* wac.epd 1.1:
	Win At Chess, 300 positions with best move information.
	pv (predicted variation) information computed using crafty 19.8 on
	a dual xeon 2.6GHZ system using 40 minutes time for each position.
	This can be used to stress test the core library.

	* chess-ics.el 1.77
	(chess-ics-server-list): Added some more servers.
	(chess-ics-regexp-alist): Make guest login on chessclub.com work.
	(chess-ics-handle-ics12): Retrieve TimeControl info from
	the ics12 board and set TimeControl game tag when initial board is
	seen.

	* wcsac.epd 1.1:
	Winning Chess Sacrifices And Cobinations
	pv information calculated using crafty 19.8 with about 30 minutes
	time per position.

2004-01-11  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ics.el 1.76: Set EPD opcode ce from material-value and
	checkmate info.

	* chess-ics.el 1.75: Merge chess-ics-parse-ics12 and
	chess-ics-handle-move into a new function chess-ics-handle-ics12,
	which is a lot easier to read now.
	Also make the <12> regexp a bit more strict to avoid false positives.

	* chess-clock.el 1.10
	(chess-clock-tick-tock): Do not decrease time if
	(chess-game-status chess-module-game) is non-nil.

	* chess-ics.el 1.74: Fixed messed up parens.

	* chess-ics.el 1.73
	(chess-ics-handler): Read the password before opening the connection.
	This corrects a race where the password can be unknown when the
	prompt appears because the user hasn't finished typing yet...
	(chess-ics12-parse): Use `pop' to make stuff simpler and use `mapc'
	to get castling info.
	Indent chess-ics-regexp-alist differently.

	* chess-engine.el 1.96
	(chess-engine-default-handler): When 'match is accepted, we were
	calling (chess-engine-command nil 'accept chess-full-name)
	which doesn't make much sense, and breaks chess-ics game accepting.
	Change it to `name', to pass the opponent name for whom we are
	accepting a match request.

	* chess-display.el 1.117: On GNU Emacs 21.3, :eval in mode-line-data
	seems only to work if it directly appears in mode-line-format.
	chess-display indirectly referenced chess-display-mode-line-format
	by setting mode-line-format to that symbol.  If we set
	mode-line-format to the value of chess-display-mode-line-format,
	the mode-line comes to life again!

2004-01-10  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-game.el 1.58: Fix a bug in `chess-game-seq' (at least I
	think it is supposed to work like it does now).

	* chess-crafty.el 1.31: Support for xboards analyze mode.
	(chess-engine-command crafty 'analyze t) enables analyze mode and
	eventually sets chess-crafty-analyzing-p to t.
	When new predicted variations arrive, corresponding epd opcodes
	are set for (chess-engine-position nil): acd, ce, pv (acn is not set because
	it is likely that it overflows the emacs integer bounds, and I am not
	yet sure what to do about this.)
	(chess-engine-command crafty 'analyze nil) turns analyze mode off again.

	* chess-plain.el 1.19: A change to the faces and a fix for
	chess-plain-spacing > 0 and file naming, all from kanaldrache, thanks.

	* chess-crafty.el 1.30:	Use Crafty's xboard protocol layer for
	communication: Since recent >19.x crafty, there is something strange
	going on with display nogeneral.  Another bug which appears sometimes
	is that	crafty (in its own mode of displaying stuff) echos the oponent
	move (our move) which raises an error (obviously).
	xboard mode is really a lot easier to parse, and I even managed
	to keep the 'evaluate event without any problems.

2004-01-09  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-epd.el 1.5: speed up chess-epd-read-file by using `nconc'.

	* chess-epd.el 1.4: Support (convert) opcodes sm and sv.

	* chess-gnuchess.el 1.34: Use `zerop'.

	* chess-epd.el 1.3: (require 'chess-var)

	* chess-epd.el 1.2: Use `chess-var-to-algebraic'.

	* chess-var.el 1.9, chess.texi 1.19: New function
	`chess-var-to-algebraic'.

2004-01-07  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-pos.el 1.42: Remove chess-pos-read-epd-file.

	* chess-display.el 1.116: Make chess-display-create interactive, and
	document chess-display-quit.

	* chess-maint.el 1.7, chess-random.el 1.5, chess.texi 1.18: Add
	`chess-fischer-random-position' into the Creating Positions Manual
	Section.

2004-01-06  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess.texi 1.17: skels for chess-database.

	* chess-ai.el 1.4: Require cl and add `message' calls.

	* chess-ply.el 1.43: Some docstrings.

	* chess.texi 1.16: Add @c lispfun for chess-ply-source and
	chess-ply-target.

	* chess-var.el 1.8: Add &optional index to `chess-var-side-to-move'
	(sync with chess-game-side-to-move) and document it, mirroring
	chess-game-side-to-move docstring.

	* chess-game.el 1.57: Document 'chess-game-side-to-move'.

	* chess-ai.el 1.3: It mostly works now, only remaining problem is
	that the players move is only displayed after the engine found a reply.

2004-01-05  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-display.el 1.115: Checkdoc attempt, some very simple
	(I hope correct) docstrings added.

	* chess.texi 1.15: add three paragraphs from chess-pos.el commentary

2004-01-04  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-ai.el 1.1: First version of a alpha-beta puring search AI.

	* chess-ply.el 1.42: Set status of next-pos according to changes of
	ply.

	* PLAN 1.50: Crafty is fixed again.

2004-01-03  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-pos.el 1.41:
	New function chess-pos-read-epd-file, which parses an epd file into a
	list of positions.

2004-01-02  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-crafty.el 1.29:	Display nogeneral seems to no longer display
	computer moves on newer crafties.  At least removing display nogeneral
	makes crafty work again.

2004-01-01  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* PLAN 1.49: Crafty is broken.

	* chess-gnuchess.el 1.33: Explicitly look for gnuchess in /usr/games.

2003-01-24  John Wiegley  <jwiegley@lexx>

	* lispdoc.el 1.4: Use a more specific signal rather than `error'.

	* chess-network.el 1.37: Add missing string-to-int form.

	* chess-engine.el 1.93:	Add status code to check for open server
	sockets.

2003-01-08  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess.el 1.65: Catch the module-not-found error.

2003-01-07  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* chess-german.el 1.8: Translate some strings.

2002-09-05  John Wiegley  <jwiegley@lexx>

	* chess-sound.el 1.14: Check chess-sound-program before using it.

	* chess-ics.el 1.58: Use `chess-engine-convert-algebraic'.

	* chess-algebraic.el 1.32: Tiny code rearrangement.  If
	`chess-ply-castling-changes' fails, no ply create will be attempted.

	* chess-autosave.el 1.7: Sped up autosaving by a huge amount; also,
	allow auto-saving to be disabled (it's not necessary when playing on
	ICS, for example).

2002-04-16  John Wiegley  <johnw@lexx>

	* chess.el 1.48: bug fix

	* chess-display.el 1.83 (chess-display-handler): Set the side-to-move
	text to a reasonable default.

	* chess-ics.el 1.36 (chess-ics-regexp-alist): Added a handler to
	capture the guest id when logging in anonymously.

	* chess-ics.el 1.34 (chess-ics12-parse): Was relying on a variable
	that wasn't set!

	* chess-ics.el 1.33: Only send startup commands after login has
	succeeded.

	* chess-ics.el 1.32: Send the "set style 12" command immediately,
	rather than after the first move.

2002-04-16  John Wiegley  <johnw@gnu.org>

	* chess-pgn.el (chess-pgn-mode): Only make bold the result text,
	not every move.

	* chess-clock.el (chess-clock-handler): Use `chess-ply-set-keyword',
	to avoid double-adding keywords.

	* chess-ply.el (chess-ply-set-keyword): Added a new function for
	setting a ply's keyword, with an optional value (must be non-nil
	for setting with a value to occur).

	* chess-ics.el (chess-ics-handle-move): Record the white and black
	remaining time as returned from the server.

	* chess-link.el (chess-link): Fixed an error in display creation,
	and which game was used.

	* chess-display.el (chess-display-handler): Set the side-to-move

	* chess-var.el, TODO, chess-algebraic.el, chess-display.el,
	chess-game.el, chess-pgn.el, chess-ply.el, chess-pos.el: Major
	speed improvement and efficiency work.  chess-legal-plies is much
	more memory conservative now.  Reduced recursion in
	chess-search-position by a slight bit.

	* chess.el: bumped minor rev

	* chess-display.el: Compute the mode-line text only once, whenever
	the current game index is changed.  This saves hundreds of calls
	to chess-ply-to-algebraic, which were occurring simply because of
	mode-line updates!

	* chess-algebraic.el: Keep the :which determiner, if ever we
	calculate it in chess-ply-to-algebraic.

	* ChangeLog, PLAN: new file

	* chess-plain.el: whitespace fix

	* chess-display.el, chess-engine.el: Removed
	`chess-with-current-buffer', since it is now in chess-module.el.

2002-04-15  Mario Lang  <mlang@aris>

	* chess-plain.el: Added var chess-plain-spacing (default 0) to be
	able to widen the board.  (I am sure that broke highlighting)

	* chess-ics.el: Added comments to chess-parse-ics12 to describe
	the format

2002-04-15  John Wiegley  <johnw@gnu.org>

	* Did some major performance work on chess-legal-plies,
	chess-ply-create and chess-search-position (these three, together
	with chess-pos-move, represent the majority of algorithmic work
	done by chess.el).

	* Created this file.
