# M-x Eglot

*E*macs Poly*glot* is the Emacs [LSP][lsp] client that stays out of
your way:

* üìΩ Scroll down this README for some [pretty gifs](#animated_gifs)
* üìö Read Eglot's [manual][manual] and [release notes][release-notes]
* üèÜ Folks over at Google [seem to like it][gospb].  Thanks!
* üëæ Eglot now lives in [Emacs itself](#emacscore)!

# Get stable [GNU ELPA][gnuelpa] version

Just type `M-x package-install RET eglot RET` into Emacs 26.3+.

Now find some source file, any source file, and type `M-x eglot`.

*That's it*. If you're lucky, this guesses the LSP program to start
for the language you're using.  Otherwise, it prompts you to enter
one.

# Get latest development version from [GNU-Devel ELPA][gnudevelelpa]

First, configure this repository.
```lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/"))
```

Then, use `M-x package-install` or `M-x package-update` to install
an ELPA package from the latest upstream.

<a name=emacscore></a>
# Contribute to Eglot's development

_**Eglot is now in Emacs's core!**_ Upcoming Emacs 29 will have `M-x
eglot` built-in.

The recommended way to experiment with changes to the latest Eglot is
to [compile][compile-emacs1] [Emacs][compile-emacs2]
[yourself][compile-emacs3-official].  

From a development perspective, moving to core allows us to work on
Eglot in tandem with other related packages already in Emacs, such as
[Flymake][flymake], [ElDoc][eldoc], [Xref][xref], [Project][project].

This means adding or tweaking an Emacs LSP feature is a matter of
submitting a single patch targetting multiple relevant packages, not
just Eglot.

These `:core` packages (Eglot included) are then released periodically
to GNU ELPA, so users of other Emacs's versions can get them via
`M-x package-install`.

# Status of this GitHub repository

This repository is **not the development upstream anymore**, but it's
**not** dead (yet):

* It may be used to start [discussions][discussion].

  Sometimes, it's possible the discussion or bug report will be moved
  to [Emacs's bug tracker][emacs-bug-tracker-eglot].  You may take the
  initiative and start discussion there using `M-x report-emacs-bug`
  or simply sending mail to `bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org`.
  
  Please the [Eglot-specific bug-reporting instructions][bug-reporting].
  
* The [`eglot.el`][eglot.el] file here is periodically updated to mirror
  the [Emacs upstream][upstream-eglot.el]

* The existing tests of [`eglot-tests.el`][eglot-tests.el], also
  periodically updated, may be used to rehearse and validate patches
  using [GitHub CI infrastructure][build-status].

box.  The full list can be consulted in the `eglot-server-programs`

# _Obligatory animated gif section_

## Completion
![eglot-completions](./gif-examples/eglot-completions.gif)

The animation shows [company-mode][company] presenting the completion
candidates to the user, but Eglot works with the built-in
`completion-at-point` function as well, which is usually bound to
`C-M-i`.

## Snippet completion
![eglot-snippets-on-completion](./gif-examples/eglot-snippets-on-completion.gif)

Eglot provides template based completion if the server supports
snippet completion and [yasnippet][yasnippet] is enabled _before_
Eglot connects to the server.  The animation shows
[company-mode][company], but `completion-at-point` also works with
snippets.

## Diagnostics
![eglot-diagnostics](./gif-examples/eglot-diagnostics.gif)

Eglot relays the diagnostics information received from the LSP server
to Emacs's [Flymake][flymake], which annotates/underlines the
problematic parts of the buffer.  The information is shared with the
[ElDoc][eldoc] system, meaning that the commands `eldoc` and
`eldoc-doc-buffer` (the latter bound to `C-h-.` for convenience) show
diagnostics along with other documentation under point.

[Flymake][flymake] provides other convenient ways to view and manage
diagnostic errors.  These are described in its [manual][flymake].

When Eglot manages a buffer, it disables pre-existing Flymake
backends.  See variable `eglot-stay-out-of` to change that.

## Code Actions
![eglot-code-actions](./gif-examples/eglot-code-actions.gif)

The LSP server may provide code actions, for example, to fix a
diagnostic error or to suggest refactoring edits.  The commands are
frequently associating with Flymake diagnostic annotations, so that
left-clicking them shows a menu.  Additionally, the command
`eglot-code-actions` asks the server for any code spanning a given
region.

Sometimes, these code actions are initiated by the server.  See
`eglot-confirm-server-initiated-edits` to control that behaviour.

## Hover on symbol /function signature
![eglot-hover-on-symbol](./gif-examples/eglot-hover-on-symbol.gif)

Here, too, the LSP server's view of a given symbol or function
signature is relayed to the [ElDoc][eldoc] system.  The commands
`eldoc` and `eldoc-doc-buffer` commands access that information.

There are customization variables to help adjust [ElDoc][eldoc]'s
liberal use of the lower "echo area", among other options.  If you
still find the solicitous nature of this LSP feature too distracing,
you can use `eglot-ignored-server-capabilities` to turn it off.

## Rename
![eglot-rename](./gif-examples/eglot-rename.gif)

Type `M-x eglot-rename RET` to rename the symbol at point.

## Find definition
![eglot-xref-find-definition](./gif-examples/eglot-xref-find-definition.gif)

To jump to the definition of a symbol, use the built-in
`xref-find-definitions` command, which is bound to `M-.`.

## Find references
![eglot-xref-find-references](./gif-examples/eglot-xref-find-references.gif)

Eglot here relies on Emacs' built-in functionality as well.
`xref-find-references` is bound to `M-?`.  Additionally, Eglot
provides the following similar commands: `eglot-find-declaration`,
`eglot-find-implementation`, `eglot-find-typeDefinition`.

# Historical differences to lsp-mode.el

Around May 2018, I wrote a comparison of Eglot to `lsp-mode.el`, and
was discussed with its then-maintainer.  That mode has since been
refactored/rewritten and now
[purports to support](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/180)
a lot of features that differentiated Eglot from it.  It may now be
very different or very similar to Eglot, or even sing with the birds
in the trees, so [go check it out][emacs-lsp].  That said, here's the
original comparison, which I will not be updating any more.

"Eglot is considerably less code and hassle than lsp-mode.el.  In most
cases, there's nothing to configure.  It's a minimalist approach
focused on user experience and performance.

User-visible differences:

- The single most visible difference is the friendly entry point `M-x
  eglot`, not `M-x eglot-<language>`.  Also, there are no
  `eglot-<language>` extra packages.

- There's no "whitelisting" or "blacklisting" directories to
  languages.  `M-x eglot` starts servers to handle file of a major
  mode inside a specific project, using Emacs's built-in `project.el`
  library to discover projects.  Then it automatically detects current
  and future opened files under that project and syncs with server;

- Easy way to quit/restart a server, just middle/right click on the
  connection name;
- Pretty interactive mode-line section for live tracking of server
  communication;
- Automatically restarts frequently crashing servers;
- Slow-to-start servers start asynchronously in the background;
- Server-initiated edits are confirmed with the user;
- Diagnostics work out-of-the-box (no `flycheck.el` needed);
- Smoother/more responsive (read below).
   
Under the hood:

- Message parser is much simpler.
- Defers signature requests like `textDocument/hover` until server is
  ready.
- Sends `textDocument/didChange` for groups of edits, not
  one per each tiny change.
- Easier to read and maintain elisp. Yeah I know, *very subjective*,
  so judge for yourself.
- Doesn't *require* anything other than Emacs, but will automatically
  upgrade to work with stuff outside Emacs, like `company`,
  `markdown-mode`, if you happen to have these installed.
- Has automated tests that check against actual LSP servers."
