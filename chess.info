1.1 Positions
=============

A chess "position" is a given layout of pieces on a chess board, also
reflecting which side is next to move, and what privileges are currently
available to each side (castling short or long, en passant capture,
etc).

   A position may be represented in ASCII using FEN (or EPD) notation,
or graphically by displaying a chess board.  It is rather inconvenient
to render them verbally.

   The position can be represented on a remote terminal using X windows,
or by transmitting the FEN string via a network connection, or
clipboard, to another chess board rendering tool.  It may of course also
be represented physically, by setting up the pieces to match the FEN
notation.

   Chess puzzles are most often provided as a set of positions.

1.1.1 Creating positions
------------------------

 -- Function: chess-pos-create &optional blank
     Create a new chess position, set at the starting position.  If
     BLANK is non-nil, all of the squares will be empty.  The current
     side-to-move is always white.

 -- Function: chess-pos-copy position
     Copy the given chess POSITION.  If there are annotations or EPD
     opcodes set, these lists are copied as well, so that the two
     positions do not share the same lists.

 -- Variable: chess-starting-position
     Starting position of a chess game.

 -- Function: chess-fischer-random-position
     Generate a Fischer Random style position.


File: chess.info,  Node: Position coordinates,  Next: Position details,  Prev: Creating positions,  Up: Positions

1.1.2 Position coordinates
--------------------------

First of all, a coordinate system of octal indices is used, where ?\044
signifies rank 4 file 4 (i.e., "e4").  Rank is numbered 0 to 7, top to
bottom, and file is 0 to 7, left to right.

 -- Function: chess-index-rank index
     Return the rank component of the given INDEX.

 -- Function: chess-index-file index
     Return the file component of the given INDEX.

 -- Function: chess-rf-to-index rank file
     Convert RANK and FILE coordinates into an octal index.

   For those who wish to use ASCII coordinates, such as "e4", there are
two conversion functions:

 -- Function: chess-coord-to-index coord
     Convert a COORD string into an index value.

 -- Function: chess-index-to-coord index
     Convert the chess position INDEX into a coord string.

   There is also one helper function for iterative changes of an index:

 -- Function: chess-incr-index index rank-move file-move
     Create a new INDEX from an old one, by adding RANK-MOVE and
     FILE-MOVE.

1.1.3 Position details
----------------------

With an octal index value, you can look up what's on a particular
square, or set that square's value:

 -- Function: chess-pos-piece position index
     Return the piece on POSITION at INDEX.

 -- Function: chess-pos-piece-p position index piece-or-color
     Return non-nil if at POSITION/INDEX there is the given
     PIECE-OR-COLOR.  If PIECE-OR-COLOR is t for white or nil for black,
     any piece of that color will do.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-piece position index piece
     Set the piece on POSITION at INDEX to PIECE.  PIECE must be one of
     K Q N B R or P. Use lowercase to set black pieces.

 -- Function: chess-pos-search position piece-or-color
     Look on POSITION anywhere for PIECE-OR-COLOR, returning all
     coordinates.  If PIECE-OR-COLOR is t for white or nil for black,
     any piece of that color will do.

 -- Function: chess-search-position position target piece &optional
          check-only no-castling
     Look on POSITION from TARGET for a PIECE that can move there.  This
     routine looks along legal paths of movement for PIECE.  It differs
     from 'chess-pos-search', which is a more basic function that
     doesn't take piece movement into account.

     If PIECE is t or nil, legal piece movements for any piece of that
     color will be considered (t for white, nil for black).  Otherwise,
     the case of the PIECE determines color.

     The return value is a list of candidates, which means a list of
     indices which indicate where a piece may have moved from.

     If CHECK-ONLY is non-nil and PIECE is either t or nil, only
     consider pieces which can give check (not the opponents king).  If
     NO-CASTLING is non-nil, do not consider castling moves.

 -- Function: chess-pos-can-castle position side
     Return whether the king on POSITION can castle on SIDE.  SIDE must
     be either ?K for the kingside, or ?Q for the queenside (use
     lowercase to query if black can castle).

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-can-castle position side value
     Set whether the king can castle on the given POSITION on SIDE.

     See 'chess-pos-can-castle'.

     It is only necessary to call this function if setting up a position
     manually.  Note that all newly created positions have full castling
     priveleges set, unless the position is created blank, in which case
     castling priveleges are unset.  See 'chess-pos-copy'.

 -- Function: chess-pos-en-passant position
     Return the index of any pawn on POSITION that can be captured en
     passant.  Returns nil if en passant is unavailable.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-en-passant position index
     Set the index of any pawn on POSITION that can be captured en
     passant.

 -- Function: chess-pos-status position
     Return whether the side to move in the POSITION is in a special
     state.  nil is returned if not, otherwise one of the symbols:
     'check', 'checkmate', 'stalemate'.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-status position value
     Set whether the side to move in POSITION is in a special state.
     VALUE should either be nil, to indicate that the POSITION is
     normal, or one of the symbols: 'check', 'checkmate', 'stalemate'.

 -- Function: chess-pos-side-to-move position
     Return the color whose move it is in POSITION.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-side-to-move position color
     Set the color whose move it is in POSITION.

 -- Function: chess-pos-passed-pawns position color &optional
          pawn-indices
     If COLOR has Passed Pawns in POSITION, return a list of their
     indices.  Optionally, if INDICES is non-nil those indices are
     considered as candidates.

     A Pawn whose advance to the eighth rank is not blocked by an
     opposing Pawn in the same file and who does not have to pass one on
     an adjoining file is called a passed Pawn.

 -- Variable: chess-pos-always-white
     When set, it is assumed that white is always on move.  This is
     really only useful when setting up training positions.  This
     variable automatically becomes buffer-local when changed.

 -- Function: chess-pos-move position &rest changes
     Move a piece on the POSITION directly, using the indices in
     CHANGES.  This function does not check any rules, it only makes
     sure you are not trying to move a blank square.

1.1.4 Annotations
-----------------

 -- Function: chess-pos-annotations position
     Return the list of annotations for this position.

 -- Function: chess-pos-add-annotation position annotation
     Add an annotation for this position.


File: chess.info,  Node: FEN notation,  Next: EPD notation,  Prev: Annotations,  Up: Positions

1.1.5 FEN notation
------------------

FEN notation encodes a chess position using a simple string.  The format
is:

   POSITION SIDE CASTLING EN-PASSANT

   The POSITION gives all eight ranks, by specifying a letter for each
piece on the position, and a number for any intervening spaces.
Trailing spaces need not be counted.  Uppercase letters signify white,
and lowercase black.  For example, if your position only had a black
king on d8, your POSITION string would be:

   3k////////

   For the three spaces (a, b and c file), the black king, and then all
the remaining ranks (which are all empty, so their spaces can be
ignored).

   The SIDE is w or b, to indicate whose move it is.

   CASTLING can contain K, Q, k or q, to signify whether the white or
black king can still castle on the king or queen side.  EN-PASSANT
signifies the target sqaure of an en passant capture, such as "e3" or
"a6".

   The starting chess position always looks like this:

   rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/////PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR/ w KQkq -

   And in "full" mode (where all spaces are accounted for):

   rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -

 -- Function: chess-fen-to-pos fen
     Convert a FEN-like notation string to a chess position.

 -- Function: chess-pos-to-fen position &optional full
     Convert a chess POSITION to FEN-like notation.  If FULL is non-nil,
     represent trailing spaces as well.


File: chess.info,  Node: EPD notation,  Prev: FEN notation,  Up: Positions

1.1.6 EPD notation
------------------

EPD is "Extended Position Description"; it is a standard for describing
chess positions along with an extended set of structured attribute
values using the ASCII character set.  It is intended for data and
command interchange among chessplaying programs.  It is also intended
for the representation of portable opening library repositories.

   A single EPD uses one text line of variable length composed of four
data field followed by zero or more operations.  The four fields of the
EPD specification are the same as the first four fields of the FEN
specification.

   A text file composed exclusively of EPD data records should have a
file name with the suffix ".epd".

 -- Function: chess-epd-to-pos &optional string
     Convert extended position description to a chess position.  If
     STRING is not specified, look for an EPD string in the current
     buffer, and advance point after the correctly parsed position.

 -- Function: chess-pos-to-epd position
     Convert a chess POSITION to a string representation in extended
     position description format.

 -- Function: chess-epd-read-file file
     Return a list of positions contained in FILE.

File: chess.info,  Node: Operations,  Next: Opcode "acd" analysis count depth,  Prev: EPD notation,  Up: EPD notation

1.1.6.1 Operations
..................

An EPD operation is composed of an opcode followed by zero or more
operands and is concluded by a semicolon.

   Multiple operations are separated by a single space character.  If
there is at least one operation present in an EPD line, it is separated
from the last (fourth) data field by a single space character.

   Some opcodes that allow for more than one operand may have special
ordering requirements for the operands.  For example, the "pv"
(predicted variation) opcode requires its operands (moves) to appear in
the order in which they would be played.  All other opcodes that allow
for more than one operand should have operands appearing in ASCII order.
An example of the latter set is the "bm" (best move[s]) opcode; its
operands are moves that are all immediately playable from the current
position.

.........................................

The opcode "acn" takes a single non-negative integer operand.  It is
used to represent the number of nodes examined in an analysis.  Note
that the value may be quite large for some extended searches and so use
of (at least) a long (four byte) representation is suggested.

1.2 Plies
=========

A "ply" is the differential between two positions.  Or, it is the
coordinate transformations applied to one position in order to arrive at
the following position.  It is also informally called "a move".

   A ply may be represented in ASCII by printing the FEN string of the
base position, and then printing the positional transformation in
algebraic notation.  Since the starting position is usually known, the
FEN string is optional.  A ply may be represented graphically by moving
the chess piece(s) involved.  It may be rendered verbally by voicing
which piece is to move, where it will move to, and what will happen a
result of the move (piece capture, check, etc).

   Plies may be sent over network connections, postal mail, e-mail,
etc., so long as the current position is maintained at both sides.
Transmitting the base position's FEN string along with the ply offers a
form of confirmation during the course of a game.

1.2.1 Creating plies
--------------------

 -- Function: chess-ply-create position &optional valid-p &rest changes
     Create a ply from the given POSITION by applying the supplied
     CHANGES.  This function will guarantee the resulting ply is legal,
     and will also annotate the ply with :check or other modifiers as
     necessary.  It will also extend castling, and will prompt for a
     promotion piece.

     Note: Do not pass in the rook move if CHANGES represents a castling
     maneuver.

 -- Function: chess-legal-plies position &rest keywords
     Return a list of all legal plies in POSITION.  KEYWORDS allowed
     are:

     :any return t if any piece can move at all :color <t or nil> :piece
     <piece character> :file <number 0 to 7> [can only be used if :piece
     is present] :index <coordinate index> :target <specific target
     index> :candidates <list of inddices>

     These will constrain the plies generated to those matching the
     above criteria.

     NOTE: All of the returned plies will reference the same copy of the
     position object passed in.

File: chess.info,  Node: Algebraic notation,  Prev: The "next" position,  Up: Plies

1.2.4 Algebraic notation
------------------------

A thing to deal with in chess is algebraic move notation, such as Nxf3+.
(I leave description of this notation to better manuals than this).
This notation is a shorthand way of representing where a piece is moving
from and to, by specifying the piece is involved, where it's going, and
whether or not a capture or check is involved.

   You can convert from algebraic notation to a ply (one pair in most
cases, but two for a castle) using the following function (NOTE:
POSITION determines which side is on move (by calling
'chess-pos-side-to-move')):

 -- Function: chess-algebraic-to-ply position move &optional trust
     Convert the algebraic notation MOVE for POSITION to a ply.

   The function also checks if a move is legal, and will raise an error
if not.

   To convert from a ply to algebraic notation, use:

 -- Function: chess-ply-to-algebraic ply &optional long
     Convert the given PLY to algebraic notation.  If LONG is non-nil,
     render the move into long notation.

   Lastly, there is a regexp for quickly checking if a string is in
algebraic notation or not, or searching out algebraic strings in a
buffer:

 -- Variable: chess-algebraic-regexp
     A regular expression that matches all possible algebraic moves.
     This regexp handles both long and short form.


File: chess.info,  Node: Variations,  Next: Games,  Prev: Plies,  Up: The chess.el library

1.3 Variations
==============

A "variation" is a sequence of plies that occur after some starting
position.  If the starting position represents the initial setup of a
chess board, and if the final ply results in completion of the game, it
is called the "main variation".  Otherwise, variations typically
represented interesting tangents during a game--but not actually
played--as envisioned by the player, an annotator, or someone studying
the game.

   Variations may be represented in ASCII by stating the FEN string for
starting position, followed by the list of plies that follow that
position.  They are difficult to represent graphically, except for
showing each position in turn with a slight pause between--or by
allowing the user to navigate each of the subsequent positions in turn.
They may be represented verbally by announcing each of the plies in
turn, as mentioned above.

1.5 Collections
===============

A "collection" is a set of games archived for later perusal.  A set of
games conceptually represents a large tree of branching variations, and
can be used for studying current theory, examining Master preferences,
etc.

   Chess.el itself does not attempt to provide library services, nor
does it ever represent library collections in memory.  Instead, it
interacts with a chess database engine for the purpose of storing and
retrieving games from the library, or performing library-wide analyses
and searches.

1.5.5.1 chess-file
..................

This module does not use an external chess database program to store and
retrieve games.  It uses the PGN of EPD format parsing routines provided
in 'chess-pgn.el' and 'chess-epd.el' to implement Collections for
ordinary PGN and EPD files.

   EPD file collections are represented as a collection of games
originating at the given position.  One might argue that conceptually,
they represent a collection of positions, but it is more convenient to
merge all collections into one uniform concept.

2 Modules
*********

Positions, plies and variations are typically accessed in reference to a
game object, which has a main variation containing the plies and
positions that represent the number of moves made within that game up to
the final position.

   Another thing that the game object does is to manage events that
occur within that game.  If a move is made from the final position, for
example, it will cause a new ply to be created, adding it to the end of
the main variation.  Then, a 'move' event is triggered within the game
and passed to any chess modules which are currently associated with that
game.  The concept of modules allows far more complex aspects of chess
playing to be dealt with, while allowing the library itself to still
operate solely in terms of the game object.

   For example, although the plies of a game object contain all the
information the computer needs to follow the game, a user needs much
more.  He wants to see the pieces move.  To support this, a display
module (see next chapter) can be created, and linked to the game.  The
first effect of this association will be to create a chess board display
and show the game's final position on it.  Now whenever plies are added
to the game, the chess board will be updated to show the effect of that
move on the board.  The display module realizes that a move has been
made by receiving the 'move' event which is passed to all modules
associated with the game object.

   There may be any number of modules associated with a chess game, and
they may do anything you like.  Basically, for a module called
chess-sample, a function must exist called 'chess-sample-handler'.  This
takes two or more arguments: a game object, the event symbol, and
whatever other arguments were passed along with the event symbol.

   When an event is triggered on a game object (and this may happen as a
byproduct of manipulating the game, or events may be manually
generated), every associated module, in order, is called with that event
and whatever arguments were passed along with the event.  The game
object is passed also, so that the module knows which game this event
has occurred in reference to.

   Once called, the module can do whatever it likes.  Some events expect
certain values to be returned, to indicate success or failure in
processing the event.  There are many different events, each depicting
something specific that might happen in the context of playing or
manipulating a chess game.  Some events relate only to the chess game
itself, some are triggered by the various chess engines that might be
associated with that game.  Modules may even trigger events in response
to event.  The game itself remains unaware of events, except for the
fact that it will pass them along to every module associated with that
game.

   This is how displays get updated, for example, because once a 'move'
event is triggered, each display knows that it must now look at the new
final position and update its display.  It may even trigger new events
special to displays, to cause a refresh to happen after update
calculations have been performed, for example.  All such details are
left to the module, and the game does not interfere with such
intra-module messaging.

   Looked at as an object-oriented design, these are typical polymorphic
events.  Certain generic situations frequently occur, such as moves,
which trigger events so that everyone concerned with the game can be
updated as to the move that occurred.  This way, no one need to actively
query the game to find out if something new has happened.  The game will
notify every listening module by sending an event.

   The core library, which consists of code to manipulate games, does
not define any modules.  The rest of the chess.el library is strictly a
set of module implementations, of various types.  Display modules react
to moves, and may modify the game based on user input; engine modules
react to moves by notifying the engine of the move; network client
modules react to moves by sending the move text over the network.
Engine and network modules may also trigger new events when the engine
or network player has decided on their move, and this move is then
applied to the game object.

   At the moment, no negotiation is done to determine which module may
modify the game object.  All modules have equal privilege.  This means
it is the programmer's duty not to associate conflicting modules with a
single game object.  If two artificial intelligence engines were linked,
for example, they would quickly start stepping on each other's toes.
But it perfectly fine to have one artificial intelligence engine, and
another passive engine whose only purpose is to relay the moves to a
networked observer on another computer.  The possibilities are endless.

   Modules are very easy to write, although engines and displays are
rather different from each other in their principles.  There is a base
engine, and a base display, which receive the same events as any other
module.  But then there are derived engines and derived displays which
trigger a whole family of events specific to those module types.  If you
suspect a bug in your module, put a breakpoint in your handler function,
and wait for the offending event to come through.  Then you can watch
what your module does in response to that event.  If it leaves the game
object alone, it should be easy to locate the problem, since it will
always be within the module itself.  But if your module also modifies
the game object in response to certain events, you may induce a feedback
loop that is much more difficult to sort out.  Test often and keep in
mind that *many* events might end up coming through as a result of the
game changes your module makes!

   That, in essence, is how the module system works.  From the game
object's perspective, it is a very simple mechanism, much like a
function ring or a hook.  The hook is called at certain points, so that
any listener can react to changes in the game.  But from each module's
perspective, it is a rich way to allow inter-operation between both
passive and reactive modules, all of them acting together to enrich the
context of play involving the central game object.

   The only other rule to be mentioned is that each module instance
should be associated with only one game object at a time, although a
game object may have unlimited modules of any type linked to it.
Otherwise, trying to update a chess board based on input from two
different games would get impossible to sort out.  Better to create a
new board for every game--the way ordinary humans would do it in the
real world.

3 Chessboard displays
*********************

The previous chapter described all the objects found in
chess--positions, plies, variations, games and collections.  However,
these objects can only be manipulated programmitically using the
functions given so far.  In order to present them in a meaningful
fashion to a human reader, it is necessary to create and use a display
object.

3.1 Generic display manipulation functions
==========================================

 -- Function: chess-display-create game style perspective
     Create a chess display, for displaying chess objects.  Where GAME
     is the chess game object to use, STYLE should be the display type
     to use (a symbol) and PERSPECTIVE determines the viewpoint of the
     board, if non-nil, the board is viewed from White's perspective.

 -- Function: chess-display-active-p
     Return non-nil if the displayed chessboard reflects an active game.
     Basically, it means we are playing, not editing or reviewing.

 -- Function: chess-display-clear-board
     Setup the current board for editing.

 -- Function: chess-display-highlight display &rest args
     Highlight the square at INDEX on the current position.  The given
     highlighting MODE is used, or the default if the style you are
     displaying with doesn't support that mode.  'selected' is a mode
     that is supported by most displays, and is the default mode.

 -- Function: chess-display-invert
     Invert the perspective of the current chess board.

 -- Function: chess-display-move display ply &optional prev-pos pos
     Move a piece on DISPLAY, by applying the given PLY.  The position
     of PLY must match the currently displayed position.  If only START
     is given, it must be in algebraic move notation.

 -- Function: chess-display-perspective display
     Return the current perspective of DISPLAY.

 -- Function: chess-display-position display
     Return the position currently viewed on DISPLAY.

 -- Function: chess-display-quit
     Quit the game associated with the current display.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-game display game &optional index
     Set the given DISPLAY to display the GAME object, optionally at
     INDEX.  This is the function to call to cause a display to view a
     game.  It will also update all of the listening engines and other
     displays to also view the same game.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-perspective display perspective
     Set PERSPECTIVE of DISPLAY.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-position display &optional position
          my-color
     Set the game associated with DISPLAY to use POSITION and MY-COLOR.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-variation display variation &optional
          index
     Set DISPLAY VARIATION.  If INDEX is not specified, this will cause
     the first ply in the variation to be displayed, with the user able
     to scroll back and forth through the moves in the variation.  Any
     moves made on the board will extend/change the variation that was
     passed in.

 -- Function: chess-display-update display &optional popup
     Update the chessboard DISPLAY.  POPUP too, if that arg is non-nil.

************************

Based on the services provided above, there is also a speical mode for
communication with Internet Chess Servers.

   ON an Internet Chess Server you can seek to play against other human
or computer players, observe other games being player or examined, play
tournaments, chat with fellow chess players, participate in a team game,
or do various other interesting chess related things.

   A default set of well known servers is defined in the following
variable:

 -- Variable: chess-ics-server-list
     A list of servers to connect to.  The format of each entry is:

     (SERVER PORT [HANDLE] [PASSWORD-OR-FILENAME] [HELPER] [HELPER

There is a special mode for displaying games sought by other users on an
Internet Chess Server.  Provided you didn't turn off seek ads manually
(for instance by setting the seek variable to 0 (off) on the ICS server
by issueing "set seek 0"), the first seek advertisment automatically
pops up a new window which is in 'chess-ics-sought-mode'.

 -- Function: chess-ics-sought-mode
     A mode for displaying ICS game seek advertisments.

     This mode runs the hook 'chess-ics-sought-mode-hook', as the final
     step during initialization.
