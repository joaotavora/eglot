1.1 Positions
=============

A chess "position" is a given layout of pieces on a chess board, also
reflecting which "side" (i.e., player) is next to move, and what
privileges are currently available to each side (castling short or long,
en passant capture, etc).

   A position may be represented in ASCII using FEN (or EPD), or
graphically by displaying a chess board.  It is rather inconvenient to
render them verbally.

   The position can be represented on a remote terminal using X windows,
or by transmitting the FEN string via a network connection or clipboard,
to another chess board rendering tool.  It may of course also be
represented physically, by setting up the pieces to match the FEN
specification.

   Chess puzzles are most often provided as a set of positions.

1.1.1 Creating positions
------------------------

 -- Function: chess-pos-create &optional blank
     Create a new chess position, set at the starting position.  If
     BLANK is non-‘nil’, all of the squares will be empty.  The current
     side-to-move is always white.

 -- Function: chess-pos-copy position
     Copy the given chess POSITION.  If there are annotations or EPD
     opcodes set, these lists are copied as well, so that the two
     positions do not share the same lists.

 -- Variable: chess-starting-position
     Starting position of a chess game.

 -- Function: chess-fischer-random-position
     Generate a Fischer Random style position.


File: chess.info,  Node: Position coordinates,  Next: Position details,  Prev: Creating positions,  Up: Positions

1.1.2 Position coordinates
--------------------------

First of all, position coordinates use a coordinate system of octal
indices, where the index ‘?\044’ signifies rank 4 file 4 (i.e., "e4").
Rank is numbered 0 to 7, top to bottom, and file is 0 to 7, left to
right.

 -- Function: chess-index-rank index
     Return the rank component of the given INDEX.

 -- Function: chess-index-file index
     Return the file component of the given INDEX.

 -- Function: chess-rf-to-index rank file
     Convert RANK and FILE coordinates into an octal index.

   For those who wish to use ASCII coordinates, such as "e4", there are
two conversion functions:

 -- Function: chess-coord-to-index coord
     Convert a COORD string into an index value.

 -- Function: chess-index-to-coord index
     Convert the chess position INDEX into a coord string.

   For fast manipulation of chess position indices, the following
constants and functions are provided:

   For queens and rooks:

 -- Constant: chess-direction-north
     Signify one step north, as seen from the perspective of the white
     player.

 -- Constant: chess-direction-east
     Signify one step east, as seen from the perspective of the white
     player.

 -- Constant: chess-direction-south
     Signify one step south, as seen from the perspective of the white
     player.

 -- Constant: chess-direction-west
     Signify one step west, as seen from the perspective of the white
     player.

   For queens and bishops:

 -- Constant: chess-direction-northeast
     Signify one step northeast, as seen from the perspective of the
     white player.

 -- Constant: chess-direction-southeast
     Signify one step southeast, as seen from the perspective of the
     white player.

 -- Constant: chess-direction-southwest
     Signify one step southwest, as seen from the perspective of the
     white player.

 -- Constant: chess-direction-northwest
     Signify one step northwest, as seen from the perspective of the
     white player.

 -- Function: chess-next-index index direction
     Create a new INDEX from an old one, by advancing it into DIRECTION.
     If the resulting index is not valid (outside the board), ‘nil’ is
     returned.

   Due to the underlying technique used to efficiently detect off-board
squares, a direction specifier should at most do two steps in any
direction.  Directions can be combined, so that ‘(*
chess-direction-north 2)’ will give a typical initial white pawn push.

1.1.3 Position details
----------------------

Given an octal index value, you can look up what’s on a particular
square, or set that square’s value:

 -- Function: chess-pos-piece position index
     Return the piece on POSITION at INDEX.

 -- Function: chess-pos-piece-p position index piece-or-color
     Return non-‘nil’ if the given PIECE-OR-COLOR is at POSITION/INDEX.
     If PIECE-OR-COLOR is ‘t’ for white or ‘nil’ for black, any piece of
     that color will do.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-piece position index piece
     Set the piece on POSITION at INDEX to PIECE.  PIECE must be one of
     ‘?K’, ‘?Q’, ‘?N’, ‘?B’, ‘?R’, or ‘?P’ for white pieces, or one of
     the corresponding lowercase letters for black pieces.

 -- Function: chess-pos-search position piece-or-color
     Look anywhere on POSITION for PIECE-OR-COLOR, returning all
     coordinates.  If PIECE-OR-COLOR is ‘t’ for white or ‘nil’ for
     black, any piece of that color will do.

 -- Function: chess-pos-search* position &rest pieces
     Look on POSITION for any of PIECES.

     The result is an alist where each element looks like
     ‘(PIECE . INDICES)’.  Pieces which did not appear in POSITION will
     be present in the resulting alist, but the ‘cdr’ of their entries
     will be ‘nil’.

 -- Function: chess-search-position position target piece &optional
          check-only no-castling
     Look on POSITION from TARGET for a PIECE that can move there.  This
     routine looks along valid paths of movement for PIECE.  It differs
     from ‘chess-pos-search’, which is a more basic function that
     doesn’t take piece movement into account.

     If PIECE is ‘t’ or ‘nil’, valid piece movements for any piece of
     that color will be considered (‘t’ for white, ‘nil’ for black).
     Otherwise, the letter-case of the PIECE determines color.

     The return value is a list of candidates, which means a list of
     indices that indicate where a piece may have moved from.

     If CHECK-ONLY is non-‘nil’ and PIECE is either ‘t’ or ‘nil’, only
     consider pieces which can give check (not the opponent’s king).  If
     NO-CASTLING is non-‘nil’, do not consider castling moves.

 -- Function: chess-pos-can-castle position side
     Return whether the king on POSITION can castle on SIDE.  The SIDE
     argument must be either ‘?K’ for the king side, or ‘?Q’ for the
     queen side (use lowercase to query if black can castle).

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-can-castle position side value
     Set whether the king can castle on the given POSITION on SIDE.

     See ‘chess-pos-can-castle’.

     It is only necessary to call this function if setting up a position
     manually.  Note that all newly created positions have full castling
     privileges set, unless the position is created blank, in which case
     castling privileges are unset.  See ‘chess-pos-create’.

 -- Function: chess-pos-en-passant position
     Return the index of any pawn on POSITION that can be captured en
     passant.  Returns ‘nil’ if en passant is unavailable.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-en-passant position index
     Set the index of any pawn on POSITION that can be captured en
     passant.

 -- Function: chess-pos-status position
     Return whether the side to move in the POSITION is in a special
     state.  Return ‘nil’ if not, otherwise one of the keywords:
     ‘:check’, ‘:checkmate’ or ‘:stalemate’.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-status position value
     Set whether the side to move in POSITION is in a special state.
     The VALUE should either be ‘nil’, to indicate that the POSITION is
     normal, or one of the symbols: ‘check’, ‘checkmate’, ‘stalemate’.

 -- Function: chess-pos-side-to-move position
     Return the color whose move it is in POSITION.

 -- Function: chess-pos-set-side-to-move position color
     Set the color whose move it is in POSITION.

 -- Function: chess-pos-passed-pawns position color &optional
          pawn-indices
     If COLOR has Passed Pawns in POSITION, return a list of their
     indices.  Optionally, if INDICES is non-‘nil’, those indices are
     considered as candidates.

     A Pawn whose advance to the eighth rank is not blocked by an
     opposing Pawn in the same file and who does not have to pass one on
     an adjoining file is called a passed Pawn.

 -- Variable: chess-pos-always-white
     When set, it is assumed that white is always on move.  This is
     really only useful when setting up training positions.  This
     variable automatically becomes buffer-local when changed.

 -- Function: chess-pos-move position &rest changes
     Move a piece on the POSITION directly, using the indices in
     CHANGES.  This function does not check any rules, it only makes
     sure you are not trying to move a blank square.

1.1.4 Annotations
-----------------

1.1.5 FEN notation
------------------

"FEN" (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) encodes a chess position using a simple
string.  The format is:

        POSITION SIDE CASTLING EN-PASSANT

   The POSITION gives all eight ranks, by specifying a letter for each
piece in the position, and a number for any intervening spaces; ranks
are separated by slashes.  Trailing spaces need not be counted.
Uppercase letters signify white pieces, and lowercase black.  For
example, if your position only had a black king on d8, your POSITION
string would be:

     3k////////

for the three spaces (a, b and c file), the black king, and then all the
remaining ranks (which are all empty, so their spaces can be ignored).

   The SIDE is ‘w’ or ‘b’, to indicate whose move it is.

   The CASTLING can contain ‘K’, ‘Q’, ‘k’ or ‘q’, to signify whether the
white or black king can still castle on the king or queen side.  If
neither color can castle on any side, ‘-’ should be provided.

   The EN-PASSANT signifies the target square of an en passant capture,
such as ‘e3’ or ‘a6’.

 -- Function: chess-fen-to-pos fen
     Convert the FEN string FEN to a chess position.

 -- Function: chess-pos-to-fen position &optional full
     Convert a chess POSITION to a FEN string.  If FULL is non-‘nil’,
     represent trailing spaces as well.

   This is how the starting position looks like:

      (chess-pos-to-fen chess-starting-position)
      ⇒ "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/////PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -"

   Some external programs might have problems parsing terse FEN strings.
If you are unsure, use the more verbose form:

      (chess-pos-to-fen chess-starting-position t)
      ⇒ "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -"


File: chess.info,  Node: EPD notation,  Prev: FEN notation,  Up: Positions

1.1.6 EPD notation
------------------

"EPD" (Extended Position Description) is a standard for describing chess
positions along with an extended set of structured attribute values
using the ASCII character set.  It is intended for data and command
interchange among chess-playing programs.  It is also intended for the
representation of portable opening library repositories.

   A single EPD uses one text line of variable length composed of four
data fields, followed by zero or more operations.  The four fields of
the EPD specification are the same as the first four fields of the FEN
specification (*note FEN notation::).

   A text file composed exclusively of EPD data records should have a
file name with the ‘.epd’ extension.

 -- Function: chess-epd-to-pos &optional string
     Convert extended position description STRING to a chess position.
     If STRING is not specified, look for an EPD string in the current
     buffer, and advance point after the correctly parsed position.

 -- Function: chess-pos-to-epd position
     Convert a chess POSITION to a string representation in extended
     position description format.

 -- Function: chess-epd-read-file file
     Return a list of positions contained in FILE.

File: chess.info,  Node: Operations,  Next: Opcode "acd" analysis count depth,  Up: EPD notation

1.1.6.1 Operations
..................

An EPD operation is composed of an opcode followed by zero or more
operands, and terminated by a semicolon.

   Multiple operations are separated by a single space character.  If
there is at least one operation present in an EPD record, it is
separated from the last (fourth) data field by a single space character.

   Some opcodes that allow for more than one operand may have special
ordering requirements for the operands.  For example, the ‘pv’
(predicted variation) opcode requires its operands (moves) to appear in
the order in which they would be played.  All other opcodes that allow
for more than one operand should have operands appearing in ASCII order.
An example of the latter set is the ‘bm’ (best move[s]) opcode; its
operands are moves that are all immediately playable from the current
position.

that the value may be quite large for some extended searches, and so use
of (at least) a long (four byte) representation is suggested.

1.2 Plies
=========

A "ply" is the differential between two positions.  In other words, it
is the coordinate transformations applied to one position in order to
arrive at the following position.  It is also informally called "a
move".

   A ply may be represented in ASCII by printing the FEN string of the
base position, and then printing the positional transformation in
algebraic notation.  Since the starting position is usually known, the
FEN string is optional.  A ply may be represented graphically by moving
the chess piece(s) involved.  It may be rendered verbally by voicing
which piece is to move, where it will move to, and what will happen a
result of the move (piece capture, check, etc).

   Plies may be sent over network connections, postal mail, e-mail,
etc., so long as the current position is maintained at both sides.
Transmitting the base position’s FEN string along with the ply offers a
form of confirmation during the course of a game.

File: chess.info,  Node: Creating plies,  Next: Ply details,  Up: Plies

1.2.1 Creating plies
--------------------

 -- Function: chess-ply-create position &optional valid-p &rest changes
     Create a ply from the given POSITION by applying the supplied
     CHANGES.  This function will guarantee the resulting ply is valid,
     and will also annotate the ply with ‘:check’ or other modifiers as
     necessary.  It will also extend castling, and will prompt for a
     promotion piece.

     Note: Do not pass in the rook move if CHANGES represents a castling
     maneuver.

 -- Function: chess-legal-plies position &rest keywords
     Return a list of all valid plies in POSITION.  The allowed KEYWORDS
     are:

     ‘:any’
          Return ‘t’ if any piece can move at all.

     ‘:color BOOLEAN’
          If BOOLEAN is ‘t’, return plies for white, if ‘nil’, return
          plies for black.

     ‘:piece CHARACTER’
          Return plies for a specific piece designated by CHARACTER.

     ‘:file FILE’
          Given a FILE, a number (0-7), return plies for any piece or
          color present on that FILE.  ‘:piece’ or ‘:color’ must be
          present.

     ‘:index INDEX’
          Return plies for the piece at INDEX.

     ‘:target INDEX’
          Return plies that go to a specific coordinate specified by
          INDEX.

     ‘:candidates INDEX...’
          If provided, only consider the source coordinates specified by
          the indices.

     These will constrain the plies generated to those matching the
     above criteria.

     NOTE: All of the returned plies will reference the same copy of the
     position object passed in.

     Set the base position of PLY.

 -- Function: chess-ply-changes
     Return the coordinate transformations and keywords associated with

1.2.4 Algebraic notation
------------------------

A thing to deal with in chess is algebraic move notation, such as
‘Nxf3+’.  This notation is a shorthand way of representing where a piece
is moving from and to, by specifying the piece involved, where it’s
going, and whether or not a capture or check is involved.

   You can convert from algebraic notation to a ply using the following
function:

 -- Function: chess-algebraic-to-ply position move &optional trust
     Convert the algebraic notation MOVE for POSITION to a ply.

     If optional argument TRUST is non-‘nil’, accept check or checkmate
     symbols (‘+’ and ‘#’) as given.

   The function also checks if a move is valid, and will raise an error
if not.

   To convert from a ply to algebraic notation, use:

 -- Function: chess-ply-to-algebraic ply &optional type
     Convert the given PLY to algebraic notation (a string).

     Optional argument TYPE specifies the kind of algebraic notation to
     generate:

     ‘:san’
          Generate short (or standard) algebraic notation.  This is the
          default.

     ‘:lan’
          Generate long algebraic notation (like ‘Nb1-c3’).

     ‘:fan’
          Generate figurine algebraic notation (uppercase letters will
          be replaced by Unicode chess figures).

     ‘:numeric’
          Generate ICCF numeric notation as used in correspondence chess
          (like ‘2133’).

   Lastly, there is a regexp for quickly checking if a string is in
algebraic notation or not, or searching out algebraic strings in a
buffer:

 -- Variable: chess-algebraic-regexp
     A regular expression that matches all possible algebraic moves.
     This regexp handles short, long and figurine algebraic notation.

1.3 Variations
==============

A "variation" is a sequence of plies that occur after some starting
position.  If the starting position represents the initial setup of a
chess board, and if the final ply results in completion of the game, it
is called “the main variation”.  Otherwise, variations typically
represented interesting tangents during a game—but not actually
played—as envisioned by the player, an annotator, or someone studying
the game.

   Variations may be represented in ASCII by stating the FEN string for
starting position, followed by the list of plies that follow that
position.  They are difficult to represent graphically, except for
showing each position in turn with a slight pause between—or by allowing
the user to navigate each of the subsequent positions in turn.  They may
be represented verbally by announcing each of the plies in turn, as
mentioned above.

1.4 Games
=========

A "game" includes its main variation, incidental information about the
game (who played it, where, when, who won, etc.), and any sub-variations
of interest to those studying the game afterwards.

   "Game tags" is an alist that associates arbitrary English tag names
to their values.

   A game may be represented in ASCII using "PGN" (Portable Game
Notation).  Representing them graphically or verbally is similar to what
is done for variations (*note Variations::).

===============

A "collection" is a set of games archived for later perusal.  A set of
games conceptually represents a large tree of branching variations, and
can be used for studying current theory, examining Master preferences,
etc.

   ‘Chess.el’ itself does not attempt to provide library services, nor
does it ever represent library collections in memory.  Instead, it
interacts with a chess database engine for the purpose of storing and
retrieving games from the library, or performing library-wide analyses
and searches.

1.6 Chess Opening Books
=======================

There are two different modules/libraries provided for looking up chess
positions in opening books.

File: chess.info,  Node: ECO Classification,  Next: Polyglot opening book format support,  Up: Chess Opening Books

1.6.1 ECO Classification
------------------------

Module ‘chess-eco’ provides a database of well known names for chess
opening positions.  If this module is activated (see variable
‘chess-default-modules’), known chess opening positions will be
announced in the minibuffer during a game.


File: chess.info,  Node: Polyglot opening book format support,  Prev: ECO Classification,  Up: Chess Opening Books

1.6.2 Polyglot opening book format support
------------------------------------------

The popular and freely documented Polyglot opening book format is
supported.  There is a default polyglot book file shipped with
‘chess.el’ to support engines which do not have built-in support for
looking up positions in opening books (such as some UCI protocol based
engines).

 -- User Option: chess-polyglot-book-file
     Path to default polyglot book file.

 -- Variable: chess-polyglot-book
     If non-‘nil’, the buffer holding the currently loaded polyglot book
     data.

     This is used by UCI based engine modules as well as the internal
     AI.

 -- Function: chess-polyglot-book-open file
     Open a polyglot book FILE.

     Returns a buffer object which contains the binary data.

 -- Function: chess-polyglot-book-plies book position
     Return a list of plies found in BOOK for POSITION.  The resulting
     list is ordered, most interesting plies come first.  The
     ‘:polyglot-book-weight’ ply keyword is used to store the actual
     move weights.  Use ‘chess-ply-keyword’ on elements of the returned
     list to retrieve them.

 -- Function: chess-polyglot-book-ply book position &optional strength
     If non-‘nil’, a (randomly picked) ply from BOOK for POSITION.
     Random distribution is defined by the relative weights of the found
     plies.  If non-‘nil’, STRENGTH defines the bias towards better
     moves.  A value below 1.0 will penalize known good moves while a
     value above 1.0 will prefer known good moves.  The default is the
     value of ‘chess-polyglot-book-strength’.  A strength value of 0.0
     will completely ignore move weights, and evenly distribute the
     probability that a move gets picked.

2 Modules
*********

Positions, plies and variations are typically accessed in reference to a
game object, which has a main variation containing the plies and
positions that represent the number of moves made within that game up to
the final position.

   Another thing that the game object does is to manage events that
occur within that game.  If a move is made from the final position, for
example, it will cause a new ply to be created, adding it to the end of
the main variation.  Then, a ‘move’ event is triggered within the game
and passed to any chess modules which are currently associated with that
game.  The concept of modules allows far more complex aspects of chess
playing to be dealt with, while allowing the library itself to still
operate solely in terms of the game object.

   For example, although the plies of a game object contain all the
information the computer needs to follow the game, a user needs much
more.  He wants to see the pieces move.  To support this, a display
module (*note Chessboard displays::) can be created, and linked to the
game.  The first effect of this association will be to create a chess
board display and show the game’s final position on it.  Now whenever
plies are added to the game, the chess board will be updated to show the
effect of that move on the board.  The display module realizes that a
move has been made by receiving the ‘move’ event which is passed to all
modules associated with the game object.

   There may be any number of modules associated with a chess game, and
they may do anything you like.  Basically, for a module called
‘chess-sample’, a function must exist called ‘chess-sample-handler’.
This takes two or more arguments: a game object, the event symbol, and
whatever other arguments were passed along with the event symbol.

   When an event is triggered on a game object (this may happen as a
byproduct of manipulating the game, or events may be manually
generated), every associated module, in order, is called with that event
and whatever arguments were passed along with the event.  The game
object is passed also, so that the module knows which game this event
has occurred in reference to.

   Once called, the module can do whatever it likes.  Some events expect
certain values to be returned, to indicate success or failure in
processing the event.  There are many different events, each depicting
something specific that might happen in the context of playing or
manipulating a chess game.  Some events relate only to the chess game
itself, some are triggered by the various chess engines that might be
associated with that game.  Modules may even trigger events in response
to event.  The game itself remains unaware of events, except for the
fact that it will pass them along to every module associated with that
game.

   This is how displays get updated, for example, because once a ‘move’
event is triggered, each display knows that it must now look at the new
final position and update its display.  It may even trigger new events
special to displays, to cause a refresh to happen after update
calculations have been performed, for example.  All such details are
left to the module, and the game does not interfere with such
intra-module messaging.

   Looked at as an object-oriented design, these are typical polymorphic
events.  Certain generic situations frequently occur, such as moves,
which trigger events so that everyone concerned with the game can be
updated as to the move that occurred.  This way, no one need to actively
query the game to find out if something new has happened.  The game will
notify every listening module by sending an event.

   The core library, which consists of code to manipulate games, does
not define any modules.  The rest of the ‘chess.el’ library is strictly
a set of module implementations, of various types.  Display modules
react to moves, and may modify the game based on user input; engine
modules react to moves by notifying the engine of the move; network
client modules react to moves by sending the move text over the network.
Engine and network modules may also trigger new events when the engine
or network player has decided on their move, and this move is then
applied to the game object.

   At the moment, no negotiation is done to determine which module may
modify the game object.  All modules have equal privilege.  This means
it is the programmer’s duty not to associate conflicting modules with a
single game object.  If two artificial intelligence engines were linked,
for example, they would quickly start stepping on each other’s toes.
But it is perfectly fine to have one artificial intelligence engine, and
another passive engine whose only purpose is to relay the moves to a
networked observer on another computer.  The possibilities are endless.

   Modules are very easy to write, although engines and displays are
rather different from each other in their principles.  There is a base
engine, and a base display, which receive the same events as any other
module.  But then there are derived engines and derived displays which
trigger a whole family of events specific to those module types.  If you
suspect a bug in your module, put a breakpoint in your handler function,
and wait for the offending event to come through.  Then you can watch
what your module does in response to that event.  If it leaves the game
object alone, it should be easy to locate the problem, since it will
always be within the module itself.  But if your module also modifies
the game object in response to certain events, you may induce a feedback
loop that is much more difficult to sort out.  Test often and keep in
mind that _many_ events might end up coming through as a result of the
game changes your module makes!

   That, in essence, is how the module system works.  From the game
object’s perspective, it is a very simple mechanism, much like a
function ring or a hook.  The hook is called at certain points, so that
any listener can react to changes in the game.  But from each module’s
perspective, it is a rich way to allow inter-operation between both
passive and reactive modules, all of them acting together to enrich the
context of play involving the central game object.

   The only other rule to be mentioned is that each module instance
should be associated with only one game object at a time, although a
game object may have unlimited modules of any type linked to it.
Otherwise, trying to update a chess board based on input from two
different games would get impossible to sort out.  Better to create a
new board for every game—the way ordinary humans would do it in the real
world.

3 Chessboard displays
*********************

The previous chapter described all the objects found in chess—positions,
plies, variations, games and collections.  However, these objects can
only be manipulated programmatically using the functions given so far.
In order to present them in a meaningful fashion to a human reader, it
is necessary to create and use a display object.

File: chess.info,  Node: Generic display manipulation functions,  Next: Chess display mode,  Up: Chessboard displays

3.1 Generic display manipulation functions
==========================================

 -- Function: chess-display-create game style perspective
     Create a chess display, for displaying chess objects.  The GAME is
     the chess game object to use, STYLE should be the display type to
     use (a symbol), and PERSPECTIVE determines the viewpoint of the
     board: if non-‘nil’, the board is viewed from White’s perspective.

 -- Function: chess-display-active-p
     Return non-‘nil’ if the displayed chessboard reflects an active
     game.  Basically, it means we are playing, not editing or
     reviewing.

 -- Function: chess-display-clear-board
     Setup the current board for editing.

 -- Function: chess-display-highlight display &rest args
     Highlight in DISPLAY the squares given in ARGS on the current
     position.

     The ARGS is a list of highlighting modes and position coordinates.
     The default highlighting mode is ‘:selected’ which is supported by
     most displays.

 -- Function: chess-display-invert
     Invert the perspective of the current chess board.

 -- Function: chess-display-move display ply
     Move a piece on DISPLAY, by applying the given PLY.  The position
     of PLY must match the currently displayed position.

 -- Function: chess-display-perspective display
     Return the current perspective of DISPLAY.

 -- Function: chess-display-position display
     Return the position currently viewed on DISPLAY.

 -- Function: chess-display-quit
     Quit the game associated with the current display.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-game display game &optional index
     Set the given DISPLAY to display the GAME object, optionally at
     INDEX.  This is the function to call to cause a display to view a
     game.  It will also update all of the listening engines and other
     displays to also view the same game.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-perspective display perspective
     Set PERSPECTIVE of DISPLAY.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-position display &optional position
          my-color
     Set the game associated with DISPLAY to use POSITION and MY-COLOR.

 -- Function: chess-display-set-variation display variation &optional
          index
     Set DISPLAY VARIATION.  If INDEX is not specified, this will cause
     the first ply in the variation to be displayed, with the user able
     to scroll back and forth through the moves in the variation.  Any
     moves made on the board will extend/change the variation that was
     passed in.

 -- Function: chess-display-update display &optional popup
     Update the chessboard DISPLAY.  If POPUP is non-‘nil’, make sure it
     is visible.

3.2 Chess display mode
======================

"Chess display mode" is a special major mode (*note (emacs)Major
Modes::) that allows to select pieces to move with the mouse or by
moving point to the desired square/piece.  Additionally, you can enter
moves in a variant of algebraic notation via the keyboard.

   All the chessboard displays described in following sub-sections share
the basic behavior provided by chess display mode.  They basically only
differ in appearance of the various chessboards.

 -- User Option: chess-display-highlight-legal
     If non-nil, highlight valid target squares when a piece is
     selected.

3.2.1 Basic operations
----------------------

‘C-i’
‘<TAB>’
     Invert the perspective of the current chess board
     (‘chess-display-invert’).

‘,’
     Show the previous move in the current game
     (‘chess-display-move-backward’).

‘C-r’
     Find previous move which algebraic notation matches a regular
     expression (‘chess-display-search-backward’).

‘C-s’
     Find next move which algebraic notation matches a regular
     expression (‘chess-display-search-forward’).

‘.’
     Show the next move in the current game
     (‘chess-display-move-forward’).

‘<’
     Move to the initial position of the current game
     (‘chess-display-move-first’).

‘>’
     Move to the last position of the current game
     (‘chess-display-move-last’).

‘C-c C-d’
     Offer to draw the current game (‘chess-display-draw’).

‘C-c C-r’
     Resign the current game (‘chess-display-resign’).

‘M-w’
‘C-u M-w’
     Copy the currently displayed position to the kill ring as a FEN
     string (‘chess-display-kill-board’).

     With prefix argument, copy the current game in PGN to the kill
     ring.

‘C-y’
     Set the current display position via a FEN string from the kill
     ring (‘chess-display-yank-board’).

     This is useful to copy positions from one chessboard display to
     another, as well as quickly setting up a position from a FEN string
     previously added to the kill ring from somewhere else.

‘X’
     Quit this chessboard display (‘chess-display-quit’).

     This destroys the session (and all related modules) associated with
     this chessboard display.

3.2.2 Selecting pieces with the keyboard
----------------------------------------

In character based chessboard displays, point can be moved around in the
buffer as usual.  You can indicate the initial square/piece and the
target square/piece by moving point to the desired position and pressing
‘<RET>’.

‘<RET>’
     Select the piece/square currently indicated by point
     (‘chess-display-select-piece’) to move from/to.

3.2.3 Selecting pieces with the mouse
-------------------------------------

Similarly, you can also use the mouse (if available) to indicate the
source and target square of your move.

‘down-mouse-1’
‘down-mouse-2’
‘drag-mouse-1’
‘drag-mouse-2’
     Select the piece/square currently indicated by the mouse pointer
     (‘chess-display-select-piece’) to move from/to.


File: chess.info,  Node: Entering moves with algebraic notation,  Prev: Selecting pieces with the mouse,  Up: Chess display mode

3.2.4 Entering moves with algebraic notation
--------------------------------------------

‘a’ … ‘h’
‘1’ … ‘8’
‘N’
‘B’
‘R’
‘Q’
‘K’
‘x’
‘=’
     Enter move in algebraic notation.

     The move will be accepted as soon as it is unambiguous.  So in most
     situations, you do not need to type the complete algebraic move
     string.  For instance, if there is only one piece which can be
     taken by one of your knights, typing ‘N x’ is sufficient to select
     that move.

     Additionally, the characters ‘x’ and ‘=’ are optional, as there is
     no difference between ‘N x e 4’ and ‘N e 4’.

<backspace>
     Delete the last entered chess move character
     (‘chess-input-shortcut-delete’).

     This is useful if you have accidentally typed a wrong character,
     and the move was not unambiguous yet.

4 Engines
*********

"Engines" represent opponents in Chess.  The main type of engine
interfaces with an external chess program.  However, there can be other
uses for engine objects, such as providing networked engined for playing
with opponent over different types of transports.

4.1 Common functions
====================

 -- Function: chess-engine-create module game &optional response-handler
          &rest handler-ctor-args
     Create a new chess engine MODULE (a symbol) associated with GAME.
     Optionally supply a new RESPONSE-HANDLER.

 -- Function: chess-engine-set-option engine option value
     Set ENGINE OPTION to VALUE by invoking its handler with the
     ‘set-option’ event.

 -- Function: chess-engine-position engine
     Return the current position of the game associated with ENGINE.

 -- Function: chess-engine-command engine event &rest args
     Call the handler of ENGINE with EVENT (a symbol) and ARGS.

 -- Function: chess-engine-send engine string
     Send the given STRING to ENGINE.  If ‘chess-engine-process’ is a
     valid process object, use ‘process-send-string’ to submit the data.
     Otherwise, the ‘send’ event is triggered and the engine event
     handler can take care of the data.

4.2 The Null Engine
===================

The most basic engine module is ‘chess-none’, a stub module that does
nothing.  This is useful for a game of chess against another human,
where both use the same computer to enter moves and display the current
chess position.

   It can also be useful for creating FEN strings of specific positions.

   To bring up a chessboard with no active engine attached, use ‘C-u M-x
chess <RET> none <RET>’.


File: chess.info,  Node: AI,  Next: Crafty,  Prev: The Null Engine,  Up: Engines

4.3 AI
======

The AI engine module defines a pure Emacs Lisp implementation of an
opponent.  Contrary to all other engine modules mentioned later on, it
does not require any external programs to be installed.

   To explicitly select this engine as an opponent, use ‘C-u M-x chess
<RET> ai <RET>’.

 -- User Option: chess-ai-depth
     Defines the default search depth for this engine.

 -- User Option: chess-ai-quiescence-depth
     Defines the number of plies to search for a quiet position.  This
     is in addition to ‘chess-ai-depth’.

   If you’d like to employ the search and evaluation functions provided
by this module programmatically, the following function is the top-level
entry point.

 -- Function: chess-ai-best-move position &optional depth eval-fn
     Find the supposedly best move (ply) for POSITION.  DEPTH defaults
     to the value of ‘chess-ai-depth’.

5 Chess Session
***************

A "chess session" assembles all modules mentioned in previous chapters
into a working system to interact with.  A session typically consists of
at least one display module, one engine module, and possibly a number of
optional modules.  All these modules share a common game object which is
used to keep track of the currently active game.

 -- Function: chess engine disable-popup engine-response-handler &rest
          engine-ctor-args
     Play a game against ENGINE.

     This function constructs all the necessary modules required for a
     chess session.  In particular, it will start ENGINE and create a
     chess display as configured in ‘chess-default-display’.

     This is the main entry-point for interactively launching a
     chessboard display with associated engine.

     If you want to launch a chess session as part of your own code, the
     probably more expressive alias ‘chess-session’ might be interesting
     to use.

   You can have several active chess sessions.  In fact, some features
later described in this manual make use of this, *note Internet Chess
Servers::.

   To interactively start a chess session, invoke ‘M-x chess <RET>’.
This uses ‘chess-default-display’ to determine the chessboard display to
use, and ‘chess-default-engine’ to determine an opponent.

   If you want to play against a specific engine, provide a prefix
argument as in ‘C-u M-x chess <RET>’, which will prompt for an engine
module.  The module name has the common prefix ‘chess-’ stripped.  So
you enter ‘gnuchess’ to indicate you’d like to play against the
‘chess-gnuchess’ module.

6 Internet Chess Servers
************************

Based on the services provided above, there is also a special mode for
communication with Internet Chess Servers.

   On an Internet Chess Server you can seek to play against other human
or computer players, observe other games being played or examined, play
tournaments, chat with fellow chess players, participate in team games,
or do various other interesting chess related things.

   A default set of well known servers is defined in the following
variable:

 -- Variable: chess-ics-server-list
     A list of servers to connect to.  The format of each entry is:

     (SERVER PORT [HANDLE] [PASSWORD-OR-FILENAME] [HELPER] [HELPER
     ARGS...])

   Internet Chess Servers based on FICS (Free Internet Chess Server)
(http://www.freechess.org/) and ICC (Internet Chess Club)
(http://www.chessclub.com/) are currently supported.

     If called interactively, you will be prompted to enter a server
     (from ‘chess-ics-server-list’ and possibly identification
     credentials.


File: chess.info,  Node: Chess ICS Mode,  Next: Command History,  Prev: Connecting to a server,  Up: Internet Chess Servers

6.2 Chess ICS Mode
==================

The major mode for ICS buffers is Chess ICS mode.  Many of its special
commands are bound to the ‘C-c’ prefix.  Here is a list of ICS mode
commands:

‘<RET>’
     Send the current line as input to the server (‘comint-send-input’).
     Any prompt at the beginning of the line is omitted.  If point is at
     the end of buffer, this is like submitting the command line in an
     ordinary interactive shell.  However, you can also invoke <RET>
     elsewhere in the ICS buffer to submit the current line as input.

‘C-d’
     Either delete a character or send EOF (End Of File)
     (‘comint-delchar-or-maybe-eof’).  Typed at the end of the ICS
     buffer, this sends EOF to the server and terminates the connection.
     Typed at any other position in the buffer, this deletes the
     character at point, as usual.

‘C-c C-a’
     Move to the beginning of the line, but after the prompt if any
     (‘comint-bol-or-process-mark’).  If you repeat this command twice
     in a row, the second time it moves back to the process mark, which
     is the beginning of the input that you have not yet sent to the
     server.  (Normally that is the same place—the end of the prompt on
     this line—but after ‘C-c <SPC>’ the process mark may be in a
     previous line.)

‘C-c <SPC>’
     Accumulate multiple lines of input, then send them together
     (‘comint-accumulate’).  This command inserts a newline before
     point, but does not send the preceding text as input to the
     server—at least, not yet.  Both lines, the one before this newline
     and the one after, will be sent together (along with the newline
     that separates them), when you type <RET>.

‘C-c C-u’
     Kill all text pending at end of buffer to be sent as input
     (‘comint-kill-input’).  If point is not at end of buffer, this only
     kills the part of this text that precedes point.

‘C-c C-w’
     Kill a word before point (‘backward-kill-word’).

‘C-c C-o’
     Delete the last batch of output from an ICS server command
     (‘comint-delete-output’).  This is useful if a server command spews
     out lots of output that just gets in the way.

‘C-c C-s’
     Write the last batch of output from an ICS server command to a file
     (‘comint-write-output’).  With a prefix argument, the file is
     appended to instead.  Any prompt at the end of the output is not
     written.

‘C-c C-r’
‘C-M-l’
     Scroll to display the beginning of the last batch of output at the
     top of the window; also move the cursor there
     (‘comint-show-output’).

‘C-c C-e’
     Scroll to put the end of the buffer at the bottom of the window
     (‘comint-show-maximum-output’).

‘M-x comint-truncate-buffer’
     This command truncates the ICS buffer to a certain maximum number
     of lines, specified by the variable ‘comint-buffer-maximum-size’.
     Here’s how to do this automatically each time you get output from
     the server:

          (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions
                    'comint-truncate-buffer)

   ICS mode is a derivative of Comint mode, a general-purpose mode for
communicating with interactive subprocesses.  Most of the features of
ICS mode actually come from Comint mode, as you can see from the command
names listed above.

6.3 ICS Command History
=======================

ICS buffers support two ways of repeating earlier commands.  You can use
keys like those used for the minibuffer history; these work much as they
do in the minibuffer, inserting text from prior commands while point
remains always at the end of the buffer.  You can move through the
buffer to previous inputs in their original place, then resubmit them or
copy them to the end.

* Menu:

* ICS Command Ring::
* ICS History Copying::


File: chess.info,  Node: ICS Command Ring,  Next: ICS History Copying,  Up: Command History

6.3.1 ICS Command History Ring
------------------------------

‘M-p’
‘C-<UP>’
     Fetch the next earlier old ICS command (‘comint-previous-input’).

‘M-n’
‘C-<DOWN>’
     Fetch the next later old ICS command (‘comint-next-input’).

‘M-r’
     Begin an incremental regexp search of old ICS commands
     (‘comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp’).

‘C-c C-x’
     Fetch the next subsequent command from the history
     (‘comint-get-next-from-history’).

‘C-c .’
     Fetch one argument from an old ICS command
     (‘comint-input-previous-argument’).

‘C-c C-l’
     Display the buffer’s history of ICS commands in another window
     (‘comint-dynamic-list-input-ring’).

   ICS buffers provide a history of previously entered commands.  To
reuse commands from the history, use the editing commands ‘M-p’, ‘M-n’,
‘M-r’ and ‘M-s’.  These work just like the minibuffer history commands
(*note (emacs)Minibuffer History::), except that they operate within the
ICS buffer rather than the minibuffer.

   ‘M-p’ fetches an earlier ICS command to the end of the ICS buffer.
Successive use of ‘M-p’ fetches successively earlier commands, each
replacing any text that was already present as potential input.  ‘M-n’
does likewise except that it finds successively more recent ICS commands
from the buffer.  ‘C-<UP>’ works like ‘M-p’, and ‘C-<DOWN>’ like ‘M-n’.

   The history search command ‘M-r’ begins an incremental regular
expression search of previous ICS commands.  After typing ‘M-r’, start
typing the desired string or regular expression; the last matching ICS
command will be displayed in the current line.  Incremental search
commands have their usual effects—for instance, ‘C-s’ and ‘C-r’ search
forward and backward for the next match (*note (emacs)Incremental
Search::).  When you find the desired input, type <RET> to terminate the
search.  This puts the input in the command line.  Any partial input you
were composing before navigating the history list is restored when you
go to the beginning or end of the history ring.

   Often it is useful to reexecute several successive ICS commands that
were previously executed in sequence.  To do this, first find and
reexecute the first command of the sequence.  Then type ‘C-c C-x’; that
will fetch the following command—the one that follows the command you
just repeated.  Then type <RET> to reexecute this command.  You can
reexecute several successive commands by typing ‘C-c C-x <RET>’ over and
over.

   The command ‘C-c .’ (‘comint-input-previous-argument’) copies an
individual argument from a previous command, like ‘<ESC> .’ in Bash.
The simplest use copies the last argument from the previous ICS command.
With a prefix argument N, it copies the Nth argument instead.  Repeating
‘C-c .’ copies from an earlier ICS command instead, always using the
same value of N (don’t give a prefix argument when you repeat the ‘C-c
.’ command).

   These commands get the text of previous ICS commands from a special
history list, not from the ICS buffer itself.  Thus, editing the ICS
buffer, or even killing large parts of it, does not affect the history
that these commands access.


File: chess.info,  Node: ICS History Copying,  Prev: ICS Command Ring,  Up: Command History

6.3.2 ICS History Copying
-------------------------

‘C-c C-p’
     Move point to the previous prompt (‘comint-previous-prompt’).

‘C-c C-n’
     Move point to the following prompt (‘comint-next-prompt’).

‘C-c <RET>’
     Copy the input command at point, inserting the copy at the end of
     the buffer (‘comint-copy-old-input’).  This is useful if you move
     point back to a previous command.  After you copy the command, you
     can submit the copy as input with <RET>.  If you wish, you can edit
     the copy before resubmitting it.  If you use this command on an
     output line, it copies that line to the end of the buffer.

‘Mouse-2’
     If ‘comint-use-prompt-regexp’ is ‘nil’ (the default), copy the old
     input command that you click on, inserting the copy at the end of
     the buffer (‘comint-insert-input’).  If ‘comint-use-prompt-regexp’
     is non-‘nil’, or if the click is not over old input, just yank as
     usual.

   Moving to a previous input and then copying it with ‘C-c <RET>’ or
‘Mouse-2’ produces the same results—the same buffer contents—that you
would get by using ‘M-p’ enough times to fetch that previous input from
the history list.  However, ‘C-c <RET>’ copies the text from the buffer,
which can be different from what is in the history list if you edit the
input text in the buffer after it has been sent.

6.4 Seeking an opponent for a new game
======================================

After you connected to a server, one of the first things you will want
to do is find an opponent for a new game.  You can use the ICS command
‘seek’ to announce your availability for a chess game to interested
people.

   For example:

     fics% seek 10 10 rated

   This will announce your availability to play a rated game with 10
minutes initial time-control for each player, and 10 seconds added for
every move made.

6.5 The sought game display
===========================

There is a special mode for displaying games sought by other users on an
Internet Chess Server.  Provided you didn’t turn off seek advertisements
manually (for instance by setting the seek variable to 0 (off) on the
ICS server by issuing "set seek 0"), the first seek advertisement
automatically pops up a new window which is in ‘chess-ics-ads-mode’, a
derivative of ‘tabulated-list-mode’.

 -- Function: chess-ics-ads-mode
     A mode for displaying ICS game seek advertisements.

     This mode runs the hook ‘chess-ics-ads-mode-hook’, as the final
     step during initialization.

     key binding — ——-

     ?		describe-mode RET	chess-ics-sought-accept <mouse-2>

   In this buffer, use ‘mouse-2’ or ‘<RET>’ on a line to accept that
particular game and play it.

   Once you start to observe a particular game or player, the current
position will pop up in a chessboard display.  As you are an observer,
you will not be able to enter new moves.  However, you should be able to
navigate back and forth in the history of the game.

   If a new move is made by any party in the game and you are currently
displaying the last position in the game, the chessboard display will
automatically update to reflect the new position and show the last move
in the mode line.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
