<!-- To continue,  you will need to provide some elements
     including a description of a [MINIMUM REPRODUCIBLE EXAMPLE][1] (MRE).  If
     you don't have that, DON'T CREATE AN BUG REPORT ISSUE.  
  
     üëâ Need help configuring or understanding Emacs, Eglot, or LSP?
       Have an idea for a feature?  Strongly sususpect there is an
       Eglot bug, but can't supply a MINIMUM REPRODUCIBLE EXAMPLE?
       Please DON'T OPEN A NEW BUG REPORT ISSUE!
  
       Head to https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions to
       discuss.  Start a new discussion, there are no templates there,
       you can just speak your mind.

     üëâ Maybe your issue is already solved or worked around.  Have glance at
       https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aworkaround
  
     üëâ You can also make an Emacs bug report, which can also be used
       for general discussion.  You'll potentially reach more people
       this way.  You can do it via `M-x report-emacs-bug` or just
       send email to `bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org`.  Be sure to `CC:` (or
       better, `X-Debbugs-CC:` ) Eglot's maintainer, currently
       `joaotavora@gmail.com`.
     
     If you don't provide the needed elements, WE MAY CLOSE THE ISSUE
     JUST LIKE THAT üòê.

* Server used:               <!-- (clangd, gopls, etc..) -->
* Emacs version:             <!-- Type M-x emacs-version -->
* Operating system:          <!-- (windows/mac osx/linux/don't know -->
* Eglot version:             <!-- Look in M-x list-packages or tell Git SHA -->
* Eglot installation method:       <!-- Git/package.el/straight/use-package/don't know -->
* Using Doom:                <!-- Yes/No -->

#### LSP transcript - M-x eglot-events-buffer (mandatory unless Emacs inoperable)
<!-- DO NOT SKIP: Include the invaluable LSP transcript.

     Inside Emacs, you can display that buffer with the M-x
     eglot-events-buffer command. It contains the JSONRPC messages
     exchanged between client and server, as well as the messages the
     server prints to stderr.  Copy that text and paste it below as a
     formatted code block
     (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)). -->
     
```lisp
... Paste the events transcript here ...  Try to start from the line that says
[client-request] (id:1) Sat Apr 10 21:40:09 2021:
(:jsonrpc "2.0" :id 1 :method "initialize" :params ...
```
    
#### Backtrace (mandatory, unless no error message seen or heard):
<!-- DO NOT SKIP: 

     If Emacs errored (you saw -- and possibly heard -- an error message), 
     make sure you repeat the process after enabling backtraces with 
     `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`.  The backtrace buffer contains text that 
     you should include here, again as a formatted code block. 
-->
     
```lisp
... Paste the backtrace here ...
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "oh no")
  signal(error ("oh no"))
  error("oh no")
  eval((error "oh no") nil)
  pp-eval-expression((error "oh no"))
  funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "oh no"))
  call-interactively(pp-eval-expression nil nil)
  command-execute(pp-eval-expression)
```
   
#### Minimum Reproducible Example (mandatory)
<!-- DO NOT SKIP: 
     
     You need to provide a MINIMAL, REPRODUCIBLE and COMPLETE recipe.
     This is the bit most trouble to some people.  So please, I kindly
     ask that you read [this first][1] for a general idea of what is
     requested.  
     
     You have to create a short guide to help us replicate the problem
     JUST AS IT HAPPENED TO YOU.  Make sure to double check that
     following your own guide leads to the problem reliably.
-->
     
Make sure to describe:

1. How Emacs is started

3. Where the language server executable lives in the machine and how
   it is installed
   
4. What project files are needed to demonstrate the problem.  Please
   don't say "_just open any Zglorb source file_".

   Don't assume the Eglot maintainers have any time to learn about a
   specific programming language and its associated toolchain. Attach
   the actual file or files, or link to a repository containing them.
   
5. How Emacs is operated/configured before you invoke Eglot

6. How Emacs is operated after you invoke Eglot

7. What actions must be taken for the problem to manifest itself

8. What the expected behaviour is

9. What the observed behaviour is

10. IMPORTANT: Double check that doing steps 1-9 all over again by
   yourself leads to the error.
   
You don't HAVE to follow this guide if you are confident you can
describe your own [COMPLETE, MINIMAL and REPRODUCIBLE][1] recipe.  See
https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/696 for a good example of
an issue following this template.
 
 <!-- THANK YOU!
 
      Having a runnable reproduction not only "proves" your bug to us
      but also allows us to spend all our effort fixing the bug
      instead of struggling to understand your issue.  
      
      If you find that building the MRE takes a lot of work, well,
      that may be so, but keep in mind that that work will have to be
      expended at least once to solve your problem, and it's often the
      most time-consuming task.  So it pays if you can do that work
      upfront.
 
      Thank you very much. -->
