* M-x Eglot
  Emacs Polyglot. Emacs client to [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol]] servers. Scroll down this README for some
[pretty gifs](#animated_gifs).

** Installation and usage

   Eglot requires Emacs 26.1 and is avaiable on [[https://elpa.gnu.org][GNU Elpa]] and [[melpa.org][Melpa]]. Installation is straightforward:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (package-install 'eglot)

   #+END_SRC

   Now find some source file and call Eglot with:  *M-x eglot*

   *That's it*. If you're lucky, Eglot guesses the LSP server executable to start
   for the language of your choice. Otherwise, it prompts you to select one:

   *M-x eglot* can guess and work out-of-the-box with these servers:

   | R                     | [[https://cran.r-project.org/package=languageserver][R Language Server]]                     |

   As more server are tested will be added to this list. In the meantime you can customize *eglot-server-programs*:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs_lisp

   (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(foo-mode . ("foo-language-server" "--args")))

   #+END_SRC

   Let us know how well it works so we can add it to the list.

   If the server has some quirk or non-conformity, it's possible to extend _Eglot_ to adapt to it.

   Here's how to get [[https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery][CQuery]] working for example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c++ mode c-mode) . (eglot-cquery "cquery")))

   #+END_SRC

   You can also enter a *server:port* pattern to connect to an LSP server. To skip the guess and always be prompted use _C-u M-x eglot_.

** Connecting automatically

   To start an *Eglot* session automatically as a foo-mode buffer is visited. You can also do:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (add-hook 'foo-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)

   #+END_SRC

** Connecting via TCP

   The examples above use a _"pipe"_ to talk to the server, which correctly works on Linux and OSX,
   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Subprocess-hang.html][but may not work on MS Windows]].

   To circumvent this limitation, or if the server doesn't like pipes,
   you can use *C-u M-x eglot* and give it *server:port* pattern to connect to a previously started TCP server serving LSP information.

   If you don't want to start it manually every time, you can configure Eglot to start it and immediately connect to it. Ruby's solargraph server already works this way out-of-the-box.

   For another example, suppose you also wanted start Python's pyls this way:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
		`(python-mode . ("pyls" "-v" "--tcp" "--host"
				 "localhost" "--port" :autoport)))
   #+END_SRC

   You can see that the element associated with *python-mode* is now a more complicated invocation of the *pyls* program,
   which requests that it be started as a server. Notice the *:autoport* symbol in there: it is replaced dynamically by a local port
   believed to be vacant, so that the ensuing TCP connection finds a listening server.

   | eglot-code-actions                  | Asks the server for any code actions at  point. These may tipically be simple fixes, like deleting an unused variable, or fixing an import. Left click on diagnostics to check if there are any there. |

   | eglot-signal-didChangeConfiguration | Updates the LSP server configuration according to the value of the variable eglot-workspace-configuration which you may be set in a *.dir-locals* file, for example.                                     |


   There are *no keybindings* specific to Eglot, but you can bind commands under *eglot-mode-map*,
   which is active as long as Eglot is managing a file in your project.

   The commands don't need to be Eglot-specific:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (define-key eglot-mode-map (kbd "C-c h") 'eglot-help-at-point)
   (define-key eglot-mode-map (kbd "<f6>") 'xref-find-definitions)

   #+END_SRC

** How Eglot do its magic exactly?

   *M-x eglot* starts a server via a shell-command guessed from *eglot-server-programs*,
   using the current major-mode (for whatever language you're programming in) as a hint.

   If the connection is successful, you see an *[eglot:<server>]* indicator pop up in your mode-line.

   More importantly, this means current *and future* file buffers of that major mode
   *inside your current project* automatically become "managed" by the LSP server,
   i.e.  information about their contents is exchanged periodically to provide enhanced code analysis
   via *xref-find-definitions*, *flymake-mode*, *eldoc-mode*, *completion-at-point*, among others.

   To "unmanage" these buffers, shutdown the server with *M-x eglot-shutdown*.
