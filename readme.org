#+TITLE: disk-usage.el

Disk Usage is a file system analyzer: it offers a tabulated view of the file
system with listings sorted by size.  Directory sizes are computed recursively.
The results are cached for speed.

This package answers the shortcomings of ~dired-du~ (notably that it's not able
to sort by size, see https://github.com/calancha/dired-du/issues/2).  It also
aims at replacing other, more limited disk analyzers such as =ncdu=.

* Installation

Get the package, either from [[https://guix.info][Guix]] or ELPA:

: M-x package-install RET mu4e-conversation RET

Or clone / download this repository and modify your ~load-path~.

: (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/this-package/" user-emacs-directory))

Load the package with

: (require 'disk-usage)

* Features

Run ~disk-usage~ or ~disk-usage-here~ to display a listing.  See ~describe-mode~
to display additional bindings, such as ~disk-usage-dired-at-point~ to open a
~dired~ buffer for the current directory.

Instead of displaying only the current folder, ~disk-usage~ can also display
files in all subfolders recursively with ~disk-usage-toggle-recursive~.

Run ~disk-usage-by-types~ to display statistics of disk usage by file
extensions.

With a prefix argument, cache is updated when reverting the buffer.

You can customize options in the 'disk-usage group.
