@section   Manual Overview

Remember that the @file{DEMO} file included in the Hyperbole
distribution demonstrates many of Hyperbole's standard facilities
without the need to read through this reference manual.

@xref{Glossary}, for definitions of Hyperbole terms.  In some cases,
terms are not precisely defined within the body of this manual since
they are defined within the glossary.  Be sure to reference the
glossary if a term is unclear to you.  Although you need not have a keen
understanding of all of these terms, a quick scan of the glossary should
help throughout Hyperbole use.

@xref{Setup}, for explanations of how to obtain, install, configure
and load Hyperbole for use.  This appendix includes information on
user-level settings that you may want to modify after you understand
Hyperbole's basic operation.

@xref{Suggestion or Bug Reporting}, for instructions on how to ask a
question, suggest a feature or report a bug in Hyperbole.  A few
commonly asked questions are answered in this manual.  @xref{Questions
and Answers}.  @xref{References}, if you are interested in classic
articles on hypertext.

@xref{Smart Keys}, for an explanation of the innovative, context-sensitive
mouse and keyboard Action and Assist Keys offered by Hyperbole.
@xref{Smart Key Reference}, for a complete reference on what the Action
and Assist Keys do in each particular context that they recognize.
@xref{Smart Key Argument Selection}, for special support that Hyperbole
provides for entering arguments when prompted for them.

Keep in mind as you read about using Hyperbole that in many cases, it
provides a number of overlapping interaction methods that support
differing work styles and hardware limitations.  In such instances,
you need learn only one technique that suits you.

@xref{Buttons}, for an overview of Hyperbole buttons and how to use them.

@xref{Menus}, for summaries of Hyperbole menu commands and how to use
the minibuffer-based menus that work on dumb terminals, PCs or workstations.

@xref{HyControl}, for how to quickly and interactively control your Emacs
windows and frames and what they display.

@xref{Koutliner}, for concept and usage information on the
autonumbered, hypertextual outliner.  @xref{Koutliner Keys}, for a full
summary of the outliner commands that are bound to keys.

@xref{HyRolo}, for concept and usage information on the
rapid lookup, hierarchical, free text record management system included
with Hyperbole.

@xref{Window Configurations}, for instructions on how to save and restore
the set of buffers and windows that appear within a frame.  This feature
lets you switch among working contexts easily, even on a dumb terminal.
Such configurations last only throughout a single session of editor
usage.

@node Motivation, Hyperbole Overview, Manual Overview, Introduction
@section   Motivation

Database vendors apply tremendous resources to help solve corporate
information management problems.  But the information that people deal
with in their everyday worklife is seldom stored away in neatly defined
database schemas.  Instead it is scattered among local and remote files,
e-mail messages, faxes, voice mail and web pages.

The rise of the web has demonstrated how hypertext technologies can be
used to build massive organized repositories of scattered information.
But assembling information for the web still remains a great challenge
to many and the data formats of the web are inherently still too
structured to deal with the great variety of information that people
process.  Modern web development often requires the use of many
languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Java.  This in itself prevents
its use as the prime means of organizing and interlinking the constant
flows of daily information.

GNU Hyperbole takes a distinctly different approach.  It has its own
hypertext technology that can interface perfectly with web links but
which are much easier to create (simply drag from the source to the
destination of a link to create a new hyperlink).  Hyperbole
hyperbuttons can link not only to static information but can perform
arbitrary actions through the use of button types written in a single,
highly interactive language, Emacs Lisp.  Hyperbole adds all of this
power to your written documents, e-mail, news articles, contact
management, outlines, directory listings, and much more.  Hyperbole
works well with the very latest versions of GNU Emacs.

Unlock the power of GNU Hyperbole to make your information work for
you.  One system. One language.  One manual.  One solution.  Learn GNU
Hyperbole and start moving further, faster.

@section   Hyperbole Overview

@cindex GNU Hyperbole
@cindex Hyperbole
@cindex hypertext
@cindex Emacs Lisp
@cindex Emacs
@cindex XEmacs
GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole, is
an efficient and programmable hypertextual information management
system.  It is intended for everyday work on any GNU Emacs platform.
Hyperbole allows hypertext buttons to be embedded within unstructured
and structured files, mail messages and news articles.  It offers
intuitive mouse-based control of information display within multiple
windows.  It also provides point-and-click access to Info manuals, ftp
archives, and the World-Wide Web (WWW).

@noindent
Hyperbole consists of five parts:

@table @emph
@item Textual Information Management
an interactive, textual information management interface, including
fast, flexible file and text finding commands.  A powerful, hierarchical
contact manager, @pxref{HyRolo}, which anyone can use, is also included.
It is easy to learn to use since it introduces only a few new mechanisms
and has a menu interface, which may be operated from the keyboard or the
mouse;

@item Screen Control
the fastest, easiest-to-use window and frame control available for GNU
Emacs, @pxref{HyControl}.  With just a few keystrokes, you can shift from
increasing a window's height by 5 lines to moving a frame by 220 pixels
or immediately moving it to a screen corner.  Text in each window or
frame may be enlarged or shrunk (zoomed) for easy viewing, plus many
other features;

@item Hypertextual Outliner
an advanced outliner, @pxref{Koutliner}, with multi-level
autonumbering and permanent identifiers attached to each outline node
for use as hypertext link anchors, per node properties and flexible
view specifications that can be embedded within links or used
interactively;

@item Button Types
a set of hyperbutton types that provides core hypertext and other
behaviors, @pxref{Buttons}.  Buttons may be added to documents (explicit
buttons) or recognized by context (implicit buttons).  Buttons are
accessed by clicking on them or referenced by name (global buttons),
so they can be activated regardless of what is on screen.  Users can make
simple changes to button types.  Emacs Lisp programmers can prototype
and deliver new types quickly;

@item Programming Library
a set of programming libraries, @pxref{Developing with Hyperbole}, for
system developers who want to integrate Hyperbole with another user
interface or as a back-end to a distinct system.  (All of Hyperbole is
written in Emacs Lisp for ease of modification.  It has been
engineered for real-world usage and is well structured).
@end table

@kindex C-h h d d
@vindex file, DEMO
@cindex demonstration
@cindex button demo
Hyperbole may be used simply for browsing through documents
pre-configured with Hyperbole buttons, in which case, you can safely
ignore most of the information in this manual; jump right into the
Hyperbole demonstration, by typing @bkbd{C-h h d d}, assuming
Hyperbole has already been installed at your site.  The demo offers a
much less technical introduction to Hyperbole by supplying good
examples of how buttons may be used and an introduction to the
Koutliner.

If you need to install Hyperbole, @pxref{Setup}, for Hyperbole

You likely will want to do more than browse with Hyperbole,
e.g.@: create your own buttons.  The standard Hyperbole button editing
user interface is Emacs-based, so a basic familiarity with the Emacs
editing model is useful.  The material covered in the Emacs
tutorial, normally bound to @bkbd{C-h t}, is more than
sufficient as background.  @xref{Glossary,,,emacs,the Emacs Manual},
if some emacs-related terms are unfamiliar to you.


@node Hyperbole Buttons, Mail Lists, Hyperbole Overview, Introduction
@section   Hyperbole Buttons

@cindex button
A Hyperbole user works with chunks of information that need to
be organized, interlinked, and processed.  Such chunks can be
hyperbuttons, rolo entries, nodes in an outline, or even database
query results.  This overview discusses buttons only, as other chapters
introduce the other parts of Hyperbole.

Hyperbole @emph{buttons} are embedded within textual documents; they may
be created, modified, moved or deleted.  Each button performs a specific
action, such as linking to a file or executing a shell command.

@cindex button, explicit
@cindex button, global
@cindex button, implicit
@cindex button category
@cindex explicit button
@cindex global button
@cindex implicit button
@noindent
There are three categories of Hyperbole buttons:
@table @dfn
@item explicit buttons
created by Hyperbole, accessible from within a single document;

@item global buttons
created by Hyperbole, specific to each user, and accessible anywhere
within a user's network of documents;

@item implicit buttons
created and managed by other programs or embedded within the structure
of a document, accessible from within a single document.  Hyperbole
recognizes implicit buttons by contextual patterns given in their type
specifications (explained later).
@end table

Explicit Hyperbole buttons may be embedded within any type of text file.
Implicit buttons may appear only within document contexts allowed by
their types, which may limit the kinds of documents or the locations
within those documents at which such buttons may be found.  All global
buttons for a user are stored in a single location and are activated by
entering their names, rather than by direct selection, the means used to
activate explicit and implicit buttons.

@noindent
To summarize:

@example
Button Category   Active Within        Activation Means      Managed By
========================================================================
Explicit          a single document    direct selection      Hyperbole
Global            any document         entering its name     Hyperbole
Implicit          a matching context   direct selection      other tools

@end example

@cindex terminal use
A click on a Hyperbole button may activate it or describe its actions,
depending on which mouse key is used.  A user always can check how a
button will behave before activating it.  Buttons may also be activated
from a keyboard.  (In fact, virtually all Hyperbole operations,
including menu usage, may be performed from any standard character
terminal interface, so one need not be anchored to a workstation all
day).  @xref{Smart Keys}.

@cindex Hyperbole features
Hyperbole does not enforce any particular hypertext or information
management model, but instead allows you to organize your information in
large or small chunks as you see fit.  The Hyperbole outliner organizes
information into hierarchies which may also contain links to external
information sources.  @xref{Koutliner}.

@noindent
Some of Hyperbole's most significant features are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Buttons may link to information or may execute procedures, such as
starting or communicating with external programs;

@item
A simple mouse drag from a button source location to its link
destination is often all that is needed to create a new link.
The keyboard can also be used to emulate such drags;

@item
Buttons may be embedded within electronic mail messages;

@item
Outlines allow rapid browsing, editing and movement of chunks of
information organized into trees (hierarchies);

@item
Other hypertext and information retrieval systems may be encapsulated
under a Hyperbole user interface (a number of samples are provided).
@end itemize

@cindex Hyperbole applications
@noindent
Typical Hyperbole applications include:

@table @emph
@item personal information management
Hyperlinks provide a variety of views into an information space.  A
search facility locates hyperbuttons in context and permits quick
selection.

@item documentation and code browsing
Cross-references may be embedded within documentation and code.  Existing
documentation may be augmented with point-and-click interfaces to link
code with associated design documents, or to permit direct access to the
definition of identifiers by selecting their names within code or
other documents.

@item brainstorming
The Hyperbole outliner (@pxref{Koutliner}) is an effective tool for
capturing ideas and then quickly reorganizing them in a meaningful way.
Links to related ideas are easy enough to create that copying and
pasting ideas together quickly becomes a dated technique.

@item help/training systems
Tutorials with buttons can show students how things work while
explaining the concepts, e.g.@: an introduction to the commands available
on a computer system.  This technique can be much more effective than
written documentation alone.

@item archive managers
Programs that manage archives from incoming information streams may be
supplemented by having them add topic-based buttons that link to the
archive holdings.  Users can then search and create their own links to
archive entries.
@end table

@node Mail Lists,  , Hyperbole Buttons, Introduction
@section   Mail Lists

If you use Hyperbole, you may join the mailing list
<hyperbole-users@@gnu.org> to discuss Hyperbole with users and maintainers.
There is a separate mail list to report problems or bugs with
Hyperbole, bug-hyperbole@@gnu.org.  For more
information, @pxref{Suggestion or Bug Reporting}.

Below are some tips on how to best structure requests and discussion
messages.  If you share information about your use of Hyperbole with
others, it will help promote broader use and development of Hyperbole.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Always use your Subject lines to state the position that your message
takes on the topic that it addresses.

@display
For example, write: ``Subject: Typo in top-level Hyperbole minibuffer menu.''

rather than: ``Subject: Hyperbole bug''
@end display

@item
Statements end with periods, questions with question marks (typically),
and high energy, high impact declarations with exclamation points.  These
simple rules make all e-mail communication much easier for recipients to
handle appropriately.

@vindex emacs-version
@item
Question messages should normally include your Hyperbole and Emacs
version numbers and should clearly explain your problem and surrounding
issues.  Otherwise, it is difficult for anyone to answer your question.
(Your top-level Hyperbole menu shows its version number and @bkbd{M-x
emacs-version @key{RET}} gives the other.)

@item
If you ask questions, you should consider adding to the discussion by
telling people the kinds of work you are doing or contemplating doing
with Hyperbole.  In this way, the list is not overrun by messages that
ask for, but provide no information.

@kindex C-u M-@key{RET}
@kindex M-@key{RET}
From the keyboard, @bkbd{M-@key{RET}} is the Action Key and @bkbd{C-u
M-@key{RET}} is the Assist Key.  These keys allow context-sensitive
operation from any keyboard.

@c Removed the following in Hyperbole 6.00 since it was not consistent
@c across all read-only modes and the standard bindings are easy
@c enough to use.
@c
@c In many read-only modes like Dired (the directory editor and file
@c manager) and Rmail (the mail reader), @{@key{RET}@} also functions as
@c the Action Key and @bkbd{C-u @key{RET}} functions as the Assist Key.

@kindex shift-middle mouse key
@kindex shift-left mouse key
@kindex shift-right mouse key
@kindex middle mouse key
@vindex hmouse-middle-flag
From the mouse, the @dfn{Action Key} is bound to your shift-middle
mouse key (or shift-left on a 2-button mouse) and the @dfn{Assist Key}
is bound to your shift-right mouse key, assuming Hyperbole is run
under an external window system.  (InfoDock users or those who set the
variable, @code{hmouse-middle-flag}, to @samp{t} before loading
Hyperbole, may also use the middle mouse key as the Action Key).

@code{hkey-either} may be used instead if you prefer a single
key binding for both commands; a prefix argument, such as @bkbd{C-u},
then invokes @code{assist-key}.  You may also bind @code{action-mouse-key}
and @code{assist-mouse-key} to other mouse keys, if you like, though
you won't be able to execute drag actions with such key bindings.

Mouse configuration of the Smart Keys is automatic for GNU Emacs under
Mac OS X, the X Window System and MS Windows, as well as for XEmacs
and InfoDock under the X window system, assuming your emacs program
has been built with support for any of these window systems.

If you ever want to restore the mouse bindings that existed before
Hyperbole was loaded, use the @code{hmouse-toggle-bindings} command.
It switches between the Hyperbole mouse key bindings and those set
prior to loading Hyperbole and then back again if invoked once more.
There is no default key binding for this command; use @bkbd{M-x
hmouse-toggle-bindings @key{RET}}.  Alternatively, you may select a
key and bind it as part of any setting of @code{hyperbole-init-hook}
within your personal @file{~/.emacs} file.  For example, @code{(add-hook
'hyperbole-init-hook (lambda () (global-set-key "\C-ct"
'hmouse-toggle-bindings)))}.

@cindex Paste Key

@cindex InfoDock Paste Key
Under InfoDock, the middle mouse key is normally used as the Action Key
and the meta-middle mouse key is used as the Paste Key.  If you prefer
that the middle mouse key be used as the Paste Key, then you will want to
toggle the mouse bindings.  InfoDock includes a built-in way to do this
via its Options/Mouse/Mouse-Paste-on-Middle-Key menu item.  (Keep in
mind though that the Action Key will paste any active region within the
editor when the Action Key is clicked; it will not paste selections from
other applications).

@cindex button activation
@cindex activation
@cindex button help
The Action Key generally selects entities, creates links and
activates buttons.  The Assist Key generally provides help,
such as reporting on a button's attributes, or serves a complementary
function to whatever the Action Key does within a context.

@cindex Smart Key operation
@cindex menu item, Doc/SmartKeys
@cindex Smart Key summary
@cindex modeline, Smart Keys
The Hyperbole Doc/SmartKeys menu entry displays a summary of what the
Smart Keys do in all of their different contexts.  Alternatively, a
click of the Assist Mouse Key in the right corner of a window
modeline (within the rightmost 3 characters) toggles between
displaying this summary and hiding it.  Reference this summary
whenever you need it.

The following table is the same summary.  Much of the browsing power
of Hyperbole comes from the use of the Smart Keys, so spend some time
practicing how to use them.  Study what modeline clicks and window
drag actions do as these will give you a lot of power without much
effort.  This table may appear daunting at first, but as you practice
and notice that the Smart Keys do just a few context-sensitive things
per editor mode, you will find it easy to just press or point and
click and let Hyperbole do the right thing in each context.

these behaviors by setting two variables.  See the documentation

@cindex context-sensitive help
When you use a mouse and you want to find out what either of the Smart
Keys does within a context, depress the one you want to check on and
hold it down, then press the other and release as you please.  A help
buffer will pop up explaining the actions that will be performed in that
context, if any.  A press of either Smart Key at the end of that
help buffer will restore your display to its configuration prior to
invoking help.

@kindex C-h A
@kindex C-u C-h A
On the keyboard, @bkbd{C-h A} displays this same context-sensitive
help for the Action Key while @bkbd{C-u C-h A} displays the help for
the Assist Key.  Note that @bkbd{C-h a} performs a function unrelated
to Hyperbole, so you must press the shift key when you type
the @key{A} character.

@node Smart Key Modeline, Smart Key Thing Selection, Smart Key Operations, Smart Keys

Smart Key clicks on a window's modeline offer many powerful browsing
features including user manual browsing, as well as window, buffer
and frame selection.

@cindex Info browser
@cindex modeline click and drag
@cindex modeline, Info Browser
A click of the Action Mouse Key in the right corner of a window
modeline (within the rightmost 3 characters) displays or hides the
GNU Info Manual Browser, giving you quick point and click access to
an amazing wealth of documentation, since the Action Key also browses
through these manuals and follows their hyperlinked cross-references.
A click of the Assist Key in the same location displays or hides the
Smart Key summary, as noted earlier.

@cindex buffer menu
@cindex modeline, buffer menu
@cindex jump menu
@cindex modeline, jump menu
An Action Mouse Key click in a blank area of a window modeline (away
from left and right edges) toggles between displaying and hiding a
list of all buffers.  Once displayed, each buffer is selectable with
the Action Key as well.  A click in the same location of the Assist
Key displays a quick access menu of display-oriented commands.  You
can jump to buffers categorized by major mode, jump to windows by
buffer name, or to frames by name.  Manage your windows and frames
quickly with this menu as well.  As always with Hyperbole, just try
it and you'll begin to wonder how you lived without it before.

Hyperbole modeline mouse click actions are controlled by the two functions,
@code{action-key-modeline} and @code{assist-key-modeline}.  If you know
a little Emacs Lisp you can change these to do whatever you like.
When a Smart Key press is on a blank part of a modeline but not at
the left or right, the function given by one of these two variables
is executed: @code{action-key-modeline-function} or
@code{assist-key-modeline-function}.  By default, the Action Key toggles
between displaying and hiding the buffer menu.  If you like the more
advanced features of @code{Ibuffer Mode}, you can change the buffer menu
to use that with the following in your Emacs initialization file:
@code{(setq action-key-modeline-function #'hmouse-context-ibuffer-menu)}.
To set it back to the default use:
@code{(setq action-key-modeline-function #'hmouse-context-menu)}.
The default @code{assist-key-modeline-function} is to pop up a menu of
convenient screen commands that lets you select buffers grouped by
major mode, use HyControl, or jump to specific windows, window
configurations or frames.

@cindex sexp selection
@cindex code block selection
@cindex selection
@cindex smart selection
@cindex smart marking
@cindex region selection
@cindex things
@cindex delimited things
Hyperbole has some radically cool ways to select regions of structured
text or source code and to copy or move them between buffers with a
single mouse drag or two key presses.  A great deal of smarts are
built-in so that it does the right thing most of the time; many other
attempts at similar behavior such as thing.el fail to deal with many
file format complexities.

We use the term @dfn{things} to refer to structured entities that
Hyperbole can select.  These include: delimited pairs of (), @{@}, <>,
[] and quote marks, source code functions, source code comments and
matching tag pairs in HTML and SGML modes.  @dfn{Delimited things} are
those things that contain a selectable delimiter such as an opening
parenthesis.

@cindex HTML tag pair
@cindex SGML tag pair
The best way to mark a delimited thing is to move your cursor to the
starting delimiter of the thing and then press the Action Key.  Typically,
you will see the thing highlight.  You can then operate upon it as you
would any Emacs region.  In many cases, you can do the same thing upon
the closing delimiter but this is not as reliable.  An Action Key
press on the start of an HTML or SGML tag pair marks the entire region
span of the pair.  If you use the Assist Key instead, it will mark and
kill (delete) the thing.

@cindex drag, with region
@cindex kill region
@cindex yank region
@cindex cut region
@cindex copy region
@cindex paste region
Even better are Smart Mouse Key drags which let you copy or move
delimited things in one operation without even highlighting them.  To
copy, simply drag with the Action Key from a thing's opening delimiter
and release somewhere outside of the thing, either within the same
window or within another window.  The thing will be copied to the
point of release.  If you want to move a thing, simply perform the
same drag but with the Assist Mouse Key.  Ensure that you do not move
any explicit buttons from one buffer to another as that does not
presently work.

Try out some of these operations in HTML or source code files to see
how they can speed your editing.

@noindent
Hyperbole also binds two convenience keys for working with things.

@kindex C-c @key{RET}
@findex hui-select-thing
@findex hui-select-thing-with-mouse
The first such key is @bkbd{C-c @key{RET}} @code{hui-select-thing}
which selects bigger and bigger syntactic regions with each successive
use.  Double or triple clicks of the Selection Key (left mouse key) do
the same thing.  The first press selects a region based upon the
character at point.  For example, with point over an opening or
closing grouping character, such as @{ or @}, the whole grouping is
selected, e.g. a C function.  When on an _ or - within a programming
language identifier name, the whole name is selected.  The type of
selection is displayed in the minibuffer as feedback.  When using a
language in which indentation determines nesting level like Python, a
double click on the first alpha character of a line, such as an if
statement, selects the whole statement.  Use @bkbd{C-g} to unmark the
region when done.  Use, @code{hui-select-thing-with-mouse} if you want
to bind this to a different mouse key to use single clicks instead of
double clicks.

@kindex C-c .
@findex hui-select-goto-matching-tag
The second convenience key is bound only in HTML/web mode.  @bkbd{C-c
.} @code{hui-select-goto-matching-tag} jumps between the opening and
closing tag of a pair.  It moves point to the start of the tag paired
with the closest tag that point is within or which it precedes.  A
second press moves point to the matching tag of the pair, allowing you
to quickly jump back and forth between opening and closing tags.

@node Smart Key Argument Selection, Smart Key Modifiers, Smart Key Thing Selection, Smart Keys
@section   Smart Key Argument Selection

@cindex Hyperbole help
A prime design criterion of Hyperbole's user interface is that you
should be able to see what an operation will do before using it.  The
Assist Key typically shows you what a button or minibuffer menu item
will do before you activate it.  Hyperbole also displays the result of
directly selecting an argument value with the Action Key, to provide
feedback as to whether the correct item has been selected.  A second
press/click is necessary before an argument is accepted and processed.

@cindex argument entry
@cindex direct selection
@cindex double click
Many Hyperbole commands prompt you for arguments.  The standard
Hyperbole user interface has an extensive core of argument types that
it recognizes.  Whenever Hyperbole is prompting you for an argument,
it knows the type that it needs and provides some error checking to
help you get it right.  More importantly, it allows you to press the
Action Key within an entity that you want to use as an argument and it
will grab the appropriate thing and show it to you at the input prompt
within the minibuffer.  If you press (click with a mouse) the Action
Key on the same thing again, it accepts the entity as the argument
and moves on.  Thus, a double click registers a desired argument.
Double-quoted strings, pathnames, mail messages, Info nodes, dired
listings, buffers, numbers, completion items and so forth are all
recognized at appropriate times.  All of the argument types mentioned
in the documentation for the Emacs Lisp @code{interactive} function
are recognized.  Experiment a little and you will quickly get used to
this direct selection technique.

@cindex completion
Wherever possible, standard Emacs completion is offered, as described in
@ref{Completion,,,emacs,the Emacs Manual}.  Remember to use @bkbd{?}
to see what your possibilities for an argument are.  Once you have a
list of possible completions on screen, press the Action Key twice on
any item to enter it as the argument.

@node Smart Key Modifiers, Smart Key Debugging, Smart Key Argument Selection, Smart Keys
@section Smart Key Modifiers

For advanced users of Emacs and Hyperbole, there is @code{hmouse-mod-mode},
a global minor mode which turns the Action Mouse Key into a @key{Control}
modifier key and the Assist Key into a @key{Meta} modifier key.  This
allows for better keyboard energy balance across hands and is useful for
reducing carpal tunnel stress.  It may also be used with a @dfn{chord
keyboard} in one hand and a mouse in the other to point at things while
simultaneously operating upon them.

@findex hmouse-mod-mode
@vindex hmouse-mod-mode
@cindex Smart Keys as modifiers
@cindex control key modifier
@cindex meta key modifier
@cindex chord keyboards
Use the @code{hmouse-mod-mode} global minor mode to enable this feature.
@bkbd{C-u M-x hmouse-mod-mode @key{RET}} enables it and adds
@samp{HyMod} to the list of modeline minor modes.  @bkbd{C-u 0 M-x
hmouse-mod-mode @key{RET}} disables it and @bkbd{M-x
hmouse-mod-mode @key{RET}} toggles it on and off.

When enabled, if the Action Key is held down while alpha characters
are typed, they are translated into @key{Control} keys instead.  The
Assist Key translates them into @key{Meta} keys.  When both Smart
Keys are depressed, @key{Control-Meta} keys are produced.  The
commands bound to the characters produced are then run.  For example,
Action Key + @bkbd{a} runs the function for @bkbd{C-a}.  If no
keys are typed while the Smart Keys are down, they operate as
normally under Hyperbole.

The code for Smart Key modifiers can be found in
@file{@code{$@{hyperb:dir@}}/hmouse-mod.el}.

@node Smart Key Debugging,  , Smart Key Modifiers, Smart Keys
@section Smart Key Debugging

Typically, @bkbd{C-h A} and @bkbd{C-u C-h A} which show Action and
Assist Key help for the current context, are sufficient for seeing how
the Smart Keys behave no matter where they are used.

@kindex C-h h c d

@cindex troubleshooting Smart Keys
@cindex Messages buffer
@cindex logging Smart Key behavior
However, if a Smart Key ever behaves differently than you think it
should or if you want to test how the Smart Keys respond in a new
context, then the Smart Key debugging flag may be of use.  You toggle
it on and off with @bkbd{C-h h c d} (minibuffer menu
Cust/Debug-Toggle).  Once enabled, this displays a message in the
minibuffer each time the Action or Assist Key is released, showing
the context of the press and its associated action, so you can see
exactly what is happening whenever you use a Smart Key.  These
messages are all prefaced with ``(HyDebug)'' and logged to the
``*Messages*'' buffer for later viewing.

@kindex C-h h m c
@kindex C-h h m r
If you do find a problem with the Smart Keys and want to report a bug,
use @bkbd{C-h h m r} to compose an email message to the bug-hyperbole
list.  Hyperbole will automatically include all of the ``(HyDebug)''
messages from your current emacs session into your email.  Similarly,
when you compose an email to the hyperbole-users mailing list
with @bkbd{C-h h m c}, these messages are also included.

@section   Explicit Buttons

@cindex explicit button
@cindex button, explicit
@cindex button label
Hyperbole creates and manages @emph{explicit buttons} which execute
specific actions when activated (typically through a button press).
They look like this @samp{<(fake button)>} to a Hyperbole user.  They
are quickly recognizable, yet relatively non-distracting as one scans
the text in which they are embedded.  The text between the @samp{<(}
and @samp{)>} delimiters is called the @dfn{button label}.  Spacing
between words within a button label is irrelevant to Hyperbole.
Button labels may wrap across several lines without causing a problem;
just be sure to select the first line of the button to activate it.

Each explicit button is assigned an action type that determines the
actions it performs.  @dfn{Link action types} connect buttons to
particular types of referents.  @dfn{Activation} of such buttons then
displays the referents.

@cindex linking, in-place
@cindex Hyperbole data model
Hyperbole does not manage referent data; this is left to the
applications that generate the data.  This means that Hyperbole
provides in-place linking and does not require reformatting of data to
integrate with Hyperbole.

Explicit buttons may be added to any editable text file; for source
code files, simply place buttons within comments.  Buttons that you
use for quick navigation to websites or other things you do often
should be added to your personal button file.  @xref{Button Files}.

@cindex button data
@cindex button attribute
@vindex file, .hypb
Hyperbole stores the @dfn{button data} that gives an explicit button its
behavior, separately from the button label, in a file named
@file{.hypb} (@file{_hypb} under MS Windows) within the same directory
as the file in which the button is created.  Thus, all files in the
same directory share a common button data file.  Button data is
comprised of individual @dfn{button attribute} values.  A user never
sees this data in its raw form but may see a formatted version by
asking for help on a button.  @xref{Smart Keys}.

@cindex button, moving
@cindex moving buttons
Explicit buttons may be freely moved about within the buffer in which
they are created.  (No present support exists for moving buttons between
buffers; support the Hyperbole project if you would like to help make
this happen).  A single button may also appear multiple times within the
same buffer; simply copy the button label with its delimiters
to a new location if you need another copy of it.

For details on explicit buttons operations such as creation, deletion
and modification, @pxref{Utilizing Explicit Buttons}.


@node Global Buttons, Implicit Buttons, Explicit Buttons, Buttons
@section   Global Buttons

@cindex global button
@cindex button, global
@cindex button label
Access to explicit buttons depends upon the information on your screen
since they are embedded within particular buffers.  Sometimes it is
useful to activate buttons without regard to the information with
which you are working.  In such instances, you use @dfn{global
buttons}, which are explicit buttons that may be activated or
otherwise operated upon by entering their labels/names when they are
prompted for, rather than selecting the buttons within a buffer.

If you want a permanent link to a file section that you can follow at
any time, you can use a global button.  Or what about an Emacs keyboard
macro that you use frequently?  Create an @code{exec-kbd-macro} button
with an easy to type name and then you can activate it whenever the need
arises.

@node Implicit Buttons, Action Types, Global Buttons, Buttons
@section   Implicit Buttons

@cindex button, implicit
@cindex implicit button
Implicit buttons are those defined by the natural structure of a
document.  They are identified by contextual patterns found within
documents.  Their behavior is determined by one or more actions which
they trigger when activated.  An action is derived from either a
Hyperbole action type specification (@pxref{Action Types}) or an Emacs
Lisp function.  Implicit button types may use the same action types that
explicit buttons use.

@vindex file, hibtypes.el
@cindex context
Implicit buttons never have any button data associated with them.
They are recognized in context based on predicate matches (boolean
conditionals) defined within implicit button types.  For example,
Hyperbole recognizes file names enclosed in double quotes and can
display their associated files in response to Action Key presses, even
if they are on off-site computers.

The Hyperbole Smart Keys offer extensive additional context-sensitive
point-and-click type behavior beyond these standard implicit button
types.  @xref{Smart Key Reference}.

Displays annotated bibliography entries defined within the same buffer
as the reference.  References must be delimited by square brackets, must
begin with a word constituent character, and must not be in buffers
whose names begin with a ` ' or `*' character.

@item debbugs-gnu-mode
@findex ibtypes debbugs-gnu-mode
@cindex bug tracking
@cindex issue tracking
Debbugs is a client-server issue tracker used by GNU free software
projects, including Hyperbole, to manage issues and maintain threads
of discussion around them.  When on a GNU Debbugs listing entry in
@code{debbugs-gnu-mode}, an Action Key press displays the discussion
of the selected issue; an Assist Key press pretty prints the status of
the issue to a window below the listing window.

@item debbugs-gnu-query
@findex ibtypes debbugs-gnu-query
This implicit button type displays the results of a Gnu debbugs query
based on the string at point and works in most kinds of buffers.  If
the query includes a single id number, it displays the original message
submission for that id and allows browsing of the followup discussion.
The following buffer text formats are accepted (with point prior to
any attribute):

@smallexample
   #id-number
   bug#id-number, bug# id-number, bug #id-number or bug id-number
   bug?attr1=val1&attr2=val2&attr3=val3

@cindex action
@cindex button action
@dfn{Action types} are special functions that specify Hyperbole button
behaviors.  Each action type may be used by any category of button:
global, explicit, or implicit.  The arguments needed by an action type
are prompted for at button creation time or in the case of an implicit
button, computed when the button is activated.  During button
activation, the arguments are fed to the action type's body to achieve
the desired result.  This body is called the button @dfn{action}.

Hyperbole handles all of this processing transparently.  As a user, all
you need know is the set of action types that you can work with when
creating explicit or global buttons.

@cindex action
@vindex hui:ebut-prompt-for-action
Action types create a convenient way of specifying button behavior
without the need to know how to program.  Expert users who are familiar
with Emacs Lisp, however, may find that they often want to tailor button
actions in a variety of ways not easily captured within a type system.
In such cases, @code{hui:ebut-prompt-for-action} should be set to
@samp{t}.  This will cause Hyperbole to prompt for an action to override
the button's action type at each explicit button creation.  For those cases
where the action type is sufficient, a @samp{nil} value should be
entered for the action.  An action may be any Lisp form that Emacs
Lisp can evaluate.

@node Button Type Precedence, Button Files, Action Types, Buttons
@section   Button Type Precedence

@cindex button precedence
@cindex button label overlap
Explicit buttons always take precedence over implicit buttons.  Thus, if
a button selection is made which falls within both an explicit and
implicit button, only the explicit button will be selected.  Explicit
button labels are not allowed to overlap; Hyperbole's behavior in such
cases is undefined.

@cindex ibtype, evaluation order
If there is no explicit button at point during a selection request,
then each implicit button type predicate is tested in turn until one
returns non-nil or all are exhausted.  Since two implicit button types
may have overlapping @dfn{domains}, those contexts in which their
predicates are true, only the first matching type is used.  The type
predicates are tested in @emph{reverse} order of definition, i.e.@:
most recently entered types are tested first, so that personal types
defined after standard system types take precedence.  It is important
to keep this order in mind when defining new implicit button types.
By making match predicates as specific as possible, one can minimize
any overlapping implicit button domains.

@cindex type redefinition
Once a type name is defined, its precedence relative to other types
remains the same even if its body is redefined, as long as its name is
not changed.  This allows incremental modifications to types without
any worry of altering their precedences.  @xref{Creating Types}, for
information on how to develop or modify types.

@node Button Files, Utilizing Explicit Buttons, Button Type Precedence, Buttons
@section   Button Files

@cindex button files
It is often convenient to create files filled with buttons as a means of
navigating distributed information pools or for other purposes.  These
files can also serve as useful roadmaps that guide a user through both
unfamiliar and highly familiar information spaces.  Files that are
created specifically for this purpose, we call @dfn{button files}.

@vindex hbmap:filename
@cindex button file, personal
@cindex button file, directory
The Hyperbole menu system provides quick access to two types of these
button files: personal and directory-specific, through the ButFile menu.
(The variable, @code{hbmap:filename}, contains the base name of these
button files.  Its standard value is @file{HYPB}.)

@vindex dir, ~/.hyperb
@vindex hbmap:dir-user
@cindex global button
A personal button file may serve as a user's own roadmap to frequently
used resources.  Selection of the ButFile/PersonalFile menu item,
@bkbd{C-h h b p}, displays this file for editing.  The default
personal button file is stored within the directory given by the
@code{hbmap:dir-user} variable whose standard value is @file{~/.hyperb}.
The default Hyperbole configuration also appends all global buttons to
the end of this file, one per line, as they are created.  So you can
edit or annotate them within the file.

A directory-specific button file may exist for each file system
directory.  Such files are useful for explaining the contents of
directories and pointing readers to particular highlights within the
directories.  Selection of the ButFile/DirFile menu item, @bkbd{C-h h
b d}, displays the button file for the current directory; this
provides an easy means of updating this file when working on a file
within the same directory.  If you want to view some other
directory-specific button file, simply use the normal Emacs file
finding commands.

One might suggest that quick menu access be provided for group-specific
and site-specific button files.  Instead, link buttons to such things
should be placed at the top of your personal button file.  This provides
a more flexible means of connecting to such resources.

@subsection  Creation

Creating explicit buttons is fun and easy.  You can always try them
out immediately after creating them or can utilize the Assist Key to
verify what buttons do.  There are two ways to create them: by
dragging between windows with the Action Mouse Key or by using the
Hyperbole menus.

@cindex button, creation
@cindex link, creation
@cindex drag
@cindex Action Key drag
@cindex creating a link
@cindex mouse drag, link creation
@cindex direct link creation
The most efficient way to create an explicit link button interactively
is to use the Action Mouse Key to drag from a button source window to
a window showing its link referent.  More specifically, you should
split your current Emacs frame into two windows: one which contains
the point at which you want a button to be inserted and another which
shows the point to which you want to link.  Depress the Action Mouse
Key at the source point for the button (anywhere but on a paired
delimiter such as double quotes or parentheses).  Then drag to the
other window and release the Action Mouse Key at the start point of
the link referent.  The process becomes quite simple with a little
practice. (@xref{By Menu, Creation Via Menus}, for a more detailed
explanation of the explicit button creation process).

If a region was selected prior to the start of the drag, it is used as
the button label, otherwise, you are prompted for the label.  Then
Hyperbole uses the link referent context to determine the type of link
to make.  If there are a few different types of links which are
applicable from the context, you will be prompted with a list of the
types.  Simply use the Action Key or the first letter of the link type
to select one of the type names and to finish the link creation.
Hyperbole will then insert explicit button delimiters around the
button label and will display a message in the minibuffer indicating
the button label, its action/link type, and any arguments, notably the
thing to which it links.

The following table shows the type of link that will be created based
upon the referent context in which the Action Key is released.

@format
@example

@kindex M-o
@kindex C-u M-o
@kindex C-x o
@findex hkey-operate
@cindex Action Key drag emulation
@cindex keyboard drag emulation
If you run Emacs under a window system and there is no prior key
binding on @bkbd{M-o} when you load Hyperbole, then you can emulate
an Action Key drag from the keyboard by typing @bkbd{M-o}, the
@code{hkey-operate} command, at the button source location, moving
to the link destination, e.g.@: with @bkbd{C-x o}, and then typing
@bkbd{M-o} again.  This simulates a depress and then release of the
Action Key.  @bkbd{C-u M-o} emulates drags of the Assist Key.
This will not work when Hyperbole is run from a dumb terminal Emacs
session since drag actions are not supported without a window system.

@node By Menu,  , By Dragging, Creation
@subsubsection Creation Via Menus

You may instead use the Hyperbole menus to create explicit buttons.
First, mark a short region of text in any fashion allowed by Emacs
and then select the Hyperbole menu item sequence, Ebut/Create.  You will
be prompted for the button's label with the marked region as the
default.  If you accept the default and enter the rest of the
information you are prompted for, the button will be created within the
current buffer and Hyperbole will surround the marked region with
explicit button delimiters to indicate success.

If you do not mark a region before invoking the button create command,
you will be prompted for both a label and a target buffer for the button
and the delimited label text will be inserted into the target buffer
after a successful button creation.

After Hyperbole has the button label and its target buffer, it will
prompt you for an action type for the button.  Use the @bkbd{?}
completion list key to see the available types.  The type selected
determines any following values for which you are prompted.

@cindex button instance
@cindex instance number
If a previous button with the same label exists in the same buffer,
Hyperbole will add an @dfn{instance number} to the label when it adds
the delimiters so that the name is unique.  Thus, you don't have to
worry about accidental button name conflicts.  If you want the same
button to appear in multiple places within the buffer, just enter the
label again and delimit it yourself or copy and paste the button with
its delimiters.  Hyperbole will interpret all occurrences of the same
delimited label within a buffer as the same button.

@cindex link, creation
If you create link buttons using the Hyperbole menus, the best
technique is to place on screen both the source buffer for the button
and the buffer to which it will link.  Mark the region of text to use
as your button label, invoke the button create command from the menu,
choose an action type which begins with @code{link-to-} and then use
the direct selection techniques mentioned in @ref{Smart Key Argument
Selection}, to select the link referent.


@node Renaming, Deletion, Creation, Utilizing Explicit Buttons
@subsection  Renaming

@cindex explicit button, renaming
@cindex button, renaming
Once an explicit button has been created, its label text must be
treated specially.  Any inter-word spacing within the label may be
freely changed, as may happen when a paragraph is refilled, but a
special command must be invoked to rename it.

The rename command operates in two different ways.  If point is within
a button label when it is invoked, it will tell you to edit the button
label and then to invoke the rename command again after the edit.  The
second invocation will actually rename the button.  If instead the
command is originally invoked outside of any explicit button, it will
prompt for the button label to replace and the label to replace it
with and then will perform the renaming.  All occurrences of the same
button in the buffer will be renamed.

@vindex file, .emacs
@vindex file, hyperbole.el
@kindex C-c C-r
@findex hui:ebut-rename
The rename command may be invoked from the Hyperbole menu via
Ebut/Rename.  A faster method is to use a key bound to the
@code{hui:ebut-rename} command.  Hyperbole typically binds this to
@bkbd{C-c C-r}.  @bkbd{C-h w hui:ebut-rename @key{RET}} will show
what if any key runs it.  If no key binding has been established or if
you prefer one of your own, simply bind it within your @file{~/.emacs}
file: @code{(global-set-key "\C-c\C-r" 'hui:ebut-rename)}.


@node Deletion, Modification, Renaming, Utilizing Explicit Buttons
@subsection  Deletion

@cindex explicit button, deleting
@cindex button, deleting
Ebut/Delete works similarly to the Rename command but deletes the
selected button.  The button's delimiters are removed to confirm the
deletion.  If the delete command is invoked with a prefix argument, then
both the button label and the delimiters are removed as confirmation.

@vindex hui:ebut-delete-confirm-p
Presently there is no way to recover a deleted button; it must
be recreated.  Therefore, the @code{hui:ebut-delete-confirm-p} variable
is true by default, causing Hyperbole to require confirmation before
interactively deleting explicit buttons.  Set it to @samp{nil} if you
prefer no confirmation.

@node Modification, Location, Deletion, Utilizing Explicit Buttons
@subsection  Modification

@cindex explicit button, modifying
@cindex button, modifying
@cindex Smart Mouse Key drag
@cindex button, attributes
Ebut/Modify prompts you with each of the elements from the button's
attributes list and allows you to modify each in turn.  Ebut/Edit does
the exact same thing and is there for people who prefer that term.

There is a quicker way to modify explicit link buttons, however.  Simply
drag with the Action Mouse Key from within the button label to a link
destination in a different window, just as you would when creating a new
button with a mouse drag.  Remember that drags may also be emulated from
the keyboard.  @xref{Creation}.

@cindex explicit button, summarizing
@cindex button, summarizing
@cindex button, help
The Ebut/Help menu may be used to summarize either a single explicit
button or all such buttons within a buffer.  The buttons summarized may
then be activated directly from the summary.

Ebut/Help/BufferButs summarizes the explicit buttons in the order in
which they appear in the buffer.  Ebut/Help/CurrentBut summarizes only
the button at point.  Ebut/Help/OrderedButs summarizes the buttons in
alphabetical order.  All of these summary commands eliminate duplicate
occurrences of buttons from their help displays.

@cindex explicit button, searching
@cindex button, searching
Ebut/Search prompts for a search pattern and searches across all the
locations in which you have previously created explicit buttons.  It
asks you whether to match to any part of a button label or to whole
labels only.  It then displays a list of button matches with a single
line of surrounding context from their sources.  Any button in the match
list may be activated as usual.  An Action Key press on the surrounding
context jumps to the associated source line.  A press on the filename
preceding the matches jumps to the file without selecting a particular
line.

There are presently no user-level facilities for globally locating
buttons created by others or for searching on particular button
attributes.

ability to yank the contents of a message being replied to, together
with all of its buttons, via the @code{(mail-yank-original)} command
bound to @bkbd{C-c C-y}.  From a user's perspective, buttons are
created in precisely the same way as in any other buffer.  They also
appear just like any other buttons to both the message sender and the
reader who uses the Hyperbole enhanced readers.  Button operation may be
tested any time before a message is sent.  A person who does not use
Hyperbole enhanced mail readers can still send messages with embedded
buttons since mail composing is independent of any mail reader
choice.

Hyperbole buttons embedded within received mail messages behave as do
any other buttons.  The mail does not contain any of the action type
definitions used by the buttons, so the receiver must have these or
she will receive an error when she activates the buttons.  Buttons
which appear in message @emph{Subject} lines are copied to summary
buffers whenever such summaries are generated.  Thus, they may be
activated from either the message or the summary buffers.

Nothing bad will happen if a mail message with explicit buttons is sent
to a non-Hyperbole user.  The user will simply see the text
of the message followed by a series of lines of button data at its end.
Hyperbole mail users never see this data in its raw form.

@vindex smail:comment
@cindex mail comment
@cindex Hyperbole mail comment
In order to alert readers of your mail messages that you can handle
Hyperbole mail buttons, you can set the variable, @code{smail:comment},
to an expression that automatically inserts a comment into each
outgoing message to announce this fact.  See its documentation for
technical details.  By default, no comment is added.  To have a
comment line added to your outgoing message, add the following to
to your @file{~/.emacs} file before the point at which you load
Hyperbole.

@smalllisp
(setq smail:comment
 (format "Comments: GNU Hyperbole mail buttons accepted, v%s.\n"
          hyperb:version))
@end smalllisp

@noindent
This will produce the following line in outgoing messages:

@example
Comments: GNU Hyperbole mail buttons accepted, vX.XX.
@end example

@vindex file, .emacs
@noindent
where the X's indicate your Hyperbole version number.  You can cut
this out of particular messages before you send them when need be.

@cindex actype, link-to-mail
A final mail-related facility provided by Hyperbole is the ability to
save a pointer to a received mail message by creating an explicit button
with a @code{link-to-mail} action type.  When prompted for the mail
message to link to, if you press the Action Key within the message, the
appropriate link parameters will be copied to the argument prompt, as
described in @ref{Smart Key Argument Selection}.

@vindex file, hyperbole.el
@cindex menu item, Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts
Explicit buttons may be embedded within outgoing USENET news articles
and may be activated from within the Gnus news reader.  Because this
involves complex changes to news support functions, this feature is
disabled by default.  Use the Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts minibuffer menu
item to enable it (enabling it for mail also enables it for news and
vice versa).

Once enabled, all Hyperbole support should work just as it does when
reading or sending mail.  @xref{Buttons in Mail}.  When reading news,
buttons which appear in message @emph{Subject} lines may be activated
within the Gnus subject buffer as well as the article buffer.  When
posting news, the *post-news* buffer is used for outgoing news
articles rather than a mail-related buffer.

Remember that the articles you post do not contain the action type
definitions used by the buttons, so the receiver must have these or she
will receive an error when she activates the buttons.  You should also
keep in mind that most USENET readers will not be using Hyperbole, so if
they receive a news article containing explicit buttons, they will
wonder what the button data at the end of the message is.  You should
therefore limit distribution of such messages.  For example, if most
people at your site read news with Gnus and use Hyperbole, it would be
reasonable to embed buttons in postings to local newsgroups.

@cindex news comment
In order to alert readers of your postings that they may send you
personal replies with embedded Hyperbole buttons, the system inserts
into news postings the same comment that is included within mail
messages, if enabled.  @xref{Buttons in Mail}, for details and an
explanation of how to turn this feature on.

Under InfoDock, XEmacs, and Emacs, pulldown and popup menus are
available to invoke Hyperbole commands, including those from the rolo
and the outliner.  These menus operate like any other application menus
and are fairly self-explanatory.  Use the @code{Remove-This-Menu}
command on the Hyperbole menubar menu to get rid of the menu if you do
not need it.  Invoking Hyperbole from the keyboard, as explained below,
will add the menu back to the menubar.

@cindex minibuffer menus
The rest of this section discusses only the
specialized @dfn{minibuffer menus} which appear in the minibuffer
window and work with all emacs versions on all display devices.
They provide similar capabilities to those of the Hyperbole menubar
but additionally allow for fast menu item selection via the keyboard
or mouse.  When used with the keyboard, they provide command access
similar to key bindings.

@kindex C-h h
@cindex minibuffer menu
@vindex file, hyperbole.el
@cindex invoking Hyperbole

@cindex Hyperbole, starting
@cindex Hyperbole main menu
The top-level Hyperbole menu is invoked from a key given in your

of the Action Mouse Key in the minibuffer.

@cindex submenus
@cindex menu help
@cindex help, menu items
@cindex menu item selection
@cindex selection, menu items
All menu items are selected via the first character of their names
(letter case does not matter) or with presses of the Action Key.  "/" at
the end of an item name indicates that it brings up a submenu.  A press
of the Assist Key on an item displays help for the item, including the
action that it performs.

@kindex C-t
@kindex q
@kindex C-g
@cindex menu, top-level
@cindex top-level menu
@cindex menu prefix
While a menu is active, to re-activate the top-level Hyperbole menu,
use @bkbd{C-t} or press the Action Key while on the menu prefix
(before the @samp{>} character).  This allows you to browse the
submenus and then return to the top menu.  You can quit without
selecting an item by using @bkbd{q} or pressing @{@key{RET}@} when at
the end of a menu.  @bkbd{C-g} aborts from the minibuffer whether you
are at a menu prompt or any other Hyperbole prompt.

@noindent
The top-level Hyperbole menu appears in the minibuffer and should look
like this:

@smallexample
@noindent
Hy>  Act Butfile/ Cust/ Doc/ Ebut/ Find/ Gbut/ Hist Ibut/ Kotl/ Msg/ Rolo/ Screen/ Win/
@end smallexample

@sp 1
@kindex @key{TAB}
@kindex M-f
@kindex Shift-
@kindex M-b
Each menu item may be selected by typing its first letter (case
insensitive), by clicking the Action Mouse Key on it, or by
using @{@key{TAB}@} or @bkbd{M-f} to move forward an
item, @bkbd{Shift-@key{TAB}} or @bkbd{M-b} to move backward an item
and @{@key{RET}@} to select the current item.

@noindent
The top-level Hyperbole minibuffer menu items serve the following purposes:

@table @strong
@cindex menu item, Act
@cindex menu item, Activate-Button-at-Point
@item Act
Activation of any button at point.  If there is no button at
point, it prompts for the label of an explicit button within the
current buffer to activate.

@cindex menu, Button-File
@cindex menu, Butfile
@cindex button file, HYPB
@vindex file, HYPB
@item Butfile/
Easy access to a directory-specific or personal file of buttons.
@file{HYPB} is the name of the directory-specific button file and
@file{~/.hyperb/HYPB} is the personal file of global buttons.
These are good places to begin experimenting with button creation.

@cindex menu, Customize

@chapter HyControl

@cindex windows control
@cindex frames control
@cindex HyControl
@cindex screen
@cindex display
Hyperbole includes the fastest, easiest-to-use Emacs window and frame
management system available, HyControl, found under the Hyperbole
Screen menu.  If you use a lot of Emacs windows or frames (typically,
window system windows) then this chapter is for you.

HyControl interactively adjusts the layout of your windows and frames
down to the pixel-level if desired.  You adjust the location, size and
display elements of your windows and frames until they look as you like
and then simply quit HyControl and go back to work.

@kindex C-c \
@kindex screen, C-c \
@cindex menu item, WindowsControl
Hyperbole typically binds the key @bkbd{C-c \\} to invoke HyControl
window control; otherwise, the Screen/WindowsControl minibuffer menu
item, @bkbd{C-h h s w}, will do the same thing.

@cindex submodes
Once in HyControl, your minibuffer window at the bottom of the
selected frame will display a summary of keys you may use to adjust
your windows until you press @bkbd{q} to quit from HyControl.  The
key, @bkbd{t}, will always toggle between controlling frames and
windows, the @dfn{submodes} of HyControl, with the upper left of the
minibuffer prompt showing which type of control is active.

@cindex numeric argument
@cindex multiplier
A number of commands take a single numeric argument, e.g. movement and
sizing, which you can enter by typing a period to clear the argument,
followed by any positive number up to 1000.  You may also use
the @bkbd{C-u} universal argument key to apply a multiplier of 4 to
the argument, any number of times.  Any entry that pushes the argument
over 1000, restarts it, so 10005 would produce an argument of 5.

@noindent
The table below explains what each key does in HyControl mode.  If the
explanation does not say otherwise, then the key applies in both window
and frame submodes.

@table @kbd

@kindex HyControl, see screen
@kindex screen, .

an argument of 0, reset the cycle position to the upper left corner.
Respects the pixel edge offsets returned by @code{hycontrol-get-screen-offsets}.

@kindex screen, keypad number
@item keypad number
In FRAME mode, move the frame directly to the screen edge position given
by the numeric keypad layout.  For example, 3 moves the frame to the
bottom right corner and 8 moves it to the middle of the top edge.
Keypad numeric keys do not adjust the argument.  Respects the pixel edge
offsets returned by @code{hycontrol-get-screen-offsets}.

@kindex screen, d

@item ]
Create a new sideways window or frame depending on mode.

@kindex screen, (
@item (

Respects the pixel edge offsets returned by
@code{hycontrol-get-screen-offsets}.

@kindex screen, =
@item =
Make the current frame's windows or all frames approximately the same
size based on mode.  In FRAME mode, all visible frames are set to the
size of the selected frame.

@kindex screen, -
@item -
Make the selected window or frame (based on mode) as small as possible
while still displaying it.
@kindex screen, +
@item +

@end table

@sp 1
The rest of this section goes into some technicalities about HyControl
settings.  You may ignore it if you are not familiar with Emacs
variables and functions.

@vindex hycontrol-screen-offset-alist
@findex hycontrol-set-screen-offsets
@findex hycontrol-get-screen-offsets
HyControl allows placement of frames at screen edges and corners. with
the frame cycle command, @bkbd{c}, and direct placement matching the
layout of the numeric keypad keys, if available.  (Note that a screen
may span multiple physical monitors).  To prevent widgets
and toolbars at the corners of the screen from being obscured,
HyControl can offset each frame from each screen edge by a fixed
number of pixels.  These offsets are specified by the variable,
@code{hycontrol-screen-offset-alist} and can differ for each type of
screen; see its documentation for details.  If you change its value,
then call @code{hycontrol-set-screen-offsets} to set any new offset
values.  @code{hycontrol-get-screen-offsets} returns the list of offsets
in clockwise order starting from the top edge.  Both functions display a
minibuffer message with the current offsets when called interactively.

@vindex hycontrol-frame-offset
@cindex creating frames
@cindex frame creation
When HyControl creates a new frame, it automatically sizes it to the
same size as the previously selected frame and offsets it from that
frame by the (X . Y) number of pixels given in the variable,
@code{hycontrol-frame-offset}.

The source code for the HyControl system is in @file{hycontrol.el}
within your Hyperbole source directory, given by @code{hyperb:dir}.
Presently, you must edit the code to change any of HyControl's internal
key bindings.  Eventually, standard local key bindings will be provided.
You can however bind the two HyControl invocation commands to keys.
These commands are, @code{hycontrol-windows} and @code{hycontrol-frames}.
Generally, you need only one of these bound to a key since when you
press that key, the other command can be reached by pressing
@bkbd{t}.

@cindex outliner
@cindex autonumber
@cindex relative autonumber
@cindex permanent identifier
@cindex idstamp
@cindex hyperlink anchor
The Hyperbole outliner, the Koutliner (pronounced Kay-outliner),
produces structured, autonumbered documents composed of hierarchies of
cells.  Each @dfn{cell} has two identifiers, a
@dfn{relative identifier} indicating its present position within the
outline and a @dfn{permanent identifier} called an @dfn{idstamp},
suitable for use within hyperlink references to the cell.  The idstamp
is typically not displayed but is available when needed.
@xref{Autonumbering}.

Cells also store their time of creation and the user who created the
cell.  User-defined attributes may also be added to cells.  @xref{Cell
Attributes}.

@cindex menu, Outline
The outliner works under GNU Emacs, XEmacs or under InfoDock.  You can tell
whether you are running a version of Emacs which supports the outliner by
pressing @bkbd{C-h h} to display the Hyperbole menu (@bkbd{q} will
quit).  If you see a @samp{Kotl/} entry in the menu, then the outliner is
available.  Otherwise, the outliner does not work with your version of
Emacs, so this section of the manual will not be of interest to you.  (The
same is true of the Hyperbole/Outline pulldown menu; if it appears, the
outliner is available for use.)

@vindex file, EXAMPLE.kotl
@cindex menu, Outline/Example
This chapter expands on the information given in the @file{EXAMPLE.kotl}
file included with Hyperbole.  Use @bkbd{C-h h k e} to display that
file, as pictured on the following page.  It is an actual outline file
that explains major outliner operations.  You can test out the viewing,
editing and motion commands with this file since a personal copy is made
when you invoke this command.

@cindex outline file suffix
@cindex outline, creating
@vindex file, .kotl suffix
In addition to the Kotl/Create menu item, you can create and experiment
with outline files simply by finding a file, @bkbd{C-x C-f}, with a
@file{.kotl} suffix.  @file{.kot} will also work for users impaired by
operating systems with 3-character suffix limitations.

@cindex root cell
@cindex top-level cell
@cindex cell, top-level
@cindex cell, idstamp 0
When a new koutline is created, an invisible root cell is added.  Its
permanent and relative ids are both 0, and it is considered to be at
level 0 in the outline.  All visible cells in the outline are at level 1
or deeper, and thus are descendants of this root cell.  Some koutliner
commands prompt for cell numbers as arguments.  An argument of 0 makes
commands operate upon the entire outline.

An initial level 1 cell is also created to make it easy to start
entering text in the outline.  A koutline always has at least one
visible cell in it.

@xref{Autonumbering}, which explains how cells are labeled according to their
respective levels in the outline and how these labels are updated as the
structure of the outline changes.


@node Autonumbering, Idstamps, Creating Outlines, Koutliner
@section   Autonumbering

@cindex autonumber
@cindex relative identifier
@xref{Adding and Killing}, for information on how to add new cells to or
remove cells from a koutline.  As you do this, or as you promote or
demote cells within the outline, the labels preceding the contents of
each cell automatically update to reflect the new structure.  These
labels are also known as @dfn{autonumbers} and as @dfn{relative ids}
because they change as the structure changes.

@cindex outline structure
The outline structure is shown by these labels and by the indentation of
each outline level.  Normally, each deeper level is indented another
three characters, to reflect the nesting.

@cindex label type, alpha
@cindex label type, legal
@cindex alpha labels
@cindex legal labels
@cindex outline, label type
The default autonumbers are called @dfn{alphanumeric labels} because
they alternate between using numbers and letters to distinguish each
successive level.  Each alphanumeric label uniquely identifies a cell's
position in an outline, so that there is no need to scan back to prior
cells to see what the current section number of an outline is.  This is
similar to a legal numbering scheme but without all the period
characters between level numbers.  As an example, 1b3 is equivalent to a
legal label of 1.2.3.  Both refer to the 3rd cell at level 3,
below the 2nd child of the first cell at level 1.  Said another way,
this is the 3rd child of the 1st cell's 2nd child.  In other words, it
is easier to visualize hierarchies than to talk about them.

Alphanumeric labels are the default because they are shorter and easier
to read aloud than equivalent legal ones.  They also simplify
distinguishing between even and odd level labels because of the
alternating character set.

@kindex C-c C-l
@cindex label type, changing
You can change the labeling scheme used in a particular outline with
the command @bkbd{C-c C-l}.  A @bkbd{?} will show all of the
labeling options.  The default, alpha labels, legal labels, and
permanent idstamps (permanent cell ids) are all available.

@cindex label separator, changing
@cindex cell, label separator
@cindex outline, label separator
@kindex C-c M-l
@kindex C-u C-c M-l
A cell label is normally followed by a period and a space, called the
@dfn{label separator}, prior to the start of the cell contents.  You can
change the separator for the current outline with @bkbd{C-c M-l}.
@bkbd{C-u C-c M-l} will additionally change the default separator
value used when new outlines are created (for the current session only).
For example, use the value "  " (two spaces) to get eliminate the
trailing period after each cell label.  The separator must be at least
two characters long but may be longer.

@vindex file, .emacs
@cindex initialization file
If you find a separator that you prefer for all outlines, change the
separator setting permanently by adding the following line to your Emacs
initialization file, @file{~/.emacs}, substituting for `your-separator':

@cindex label separator, default
@vindex kview:default-label-separator
@smalllisp
(setq kview:default-label-separator "your-separator")
@end smalllisp


@node Idstamps, Editing, Autonumbering, Koutliner
@section   Idstamps

@cindex permanent identifier
@cindex idstamp
Idstamps (permanent ids) are associated with each cell.  They maintain
hyperlinks as cells are reordered within a koutline.  @xref{Links}.
Idstamps may be displayed in place of the outline level relative ids.
Use @bkbd{C-c C-l id @key{RET}}.

@cindex idstamp counter
An idstamp counter for each outline starts at 0 and is incremented by
one each time a cell is added to the outline.  This idstamp stays with
the cell no matter where it is moved within the outline.  If the cell is
deleted, its idstamp is not reused.

@cindex root cell
@cindex top-level cell
@cindex cell, top-level
@cindex cell, idstamp 0
@cindex idstamp 0
The 0 idstamp is always assigned to the root node of the entire outline.
This node is never visible within the outline, but is used so that the
outline may be treated as a single tree when needed.  Idstamps always
begin with a 0, as in 012, to distinguish them from relative ids.


@node Editing, Viewing, Idstamps, Koutliner
@section   Editing

Text editing within the Koutliner works just as it does for other
buffers, except when you need to deal with the structural components of
an outline.  Within the contents of a cell, all of your standard editing
keys should work properly.  You can just type in text and the left and
right margins of the lines will be maintained for you.  @xref{Filling},
for the times when you need to refill a paragraph or to control when
filling occurs.

Don't invoke editing commands with @bkbd{M-x command-name @key{RET}}
since the Koutliner uses differently named commands made to act
like the regular editing commands.  Koutliner commands, however, account
for the structure and indentation in koutlines.

@cindex cell, selection
You may use the mouse to select parts of the contents of a single cell
for editing.  But don't drag across cell boundaries and then edit the
selected region, since that will destroy the outline structure.

@subsection  Relocating and Copying

@cindex promotion
@cindex demotion
@cindex tree, promoting
@cindex tree, demoting
@dfn{Demotion} is the act of moving a tree down one or more levels in the
outline.  The new tree will become either the successor or the first
child of the cell which precedes it in the outline.  @dfn{Promotion} is
the inverse operation.  Note that trees (cells and their entire
substructure) are promoted and demoted, not individual cells.

@kindex @key{TAB}
@kindex M-@key{TAB}
Trees may be demoted or promoted by pressing @key{TAB} or
@bkbd{M-@key{TAB}} (or @bkbd{@key{SHIFT}-@key{TAB}}) respectively, as in
most outliners today.  @bkbd{M-0 @key{TAB}} and @bkbd{M-0 M-@key{TAB}}
demote and promote trees and additionally refill each cell that is not
specially marked to prevent refilling.  @xref{Filling}.  A positive or
negative prefix argument to these commands promotes or demotes the tree
up to a maximum of the number of levels given by the argument.  The
outline may not support movement of the tree by the number of levels
requested, however, in which case the maximal possible adjustment is
made.

@kindex M-1 @key{TAB}
@cindex inserting tabs
@cindex tabs, inserting
@vindex kotl-mode:indent-tabs-mode
@cindex Koutliner, toggle tab behavior
@bkbd{M-1 @key{TAB}} behaves specially.  It toggles the function of
@key{TAB} and @bkbd{M-@key{TAB}} so that they insert a tab
and remove the previous character, respectively.  This is useful when
one is formatting information within a single cell.  When in this
mode, @bkbd{@key{TAB}} inserts a literal TAB character, by default.
Set the variable, @code{kotl-mode:indent-tabs-mode}, to
@samp{nil} if you want space characters used to form the tab.
Use @bkbd{M-1 @key{TAB}} to toggle the @key{TAB} and
@bkbd{M-@key{TAB}} keys back to promoting and demoting trees.

@cindex tree, copying
@cindex tree, moving
@cindex Action Key, cell argument
@kindex Action Key, cell argument
For maximum flexibility in rearranging outlines, there are commands that
move or copy entire trees.  Each of these commands prompts for the label
of the root cell to move or copy and for a second cell which specifies
the new location for the moved or copied tree.  You may either accept
the default provided, type in the cell label, or when a mouse is
available, simply double click with the Action Key on the contents of a
cell.  The Koutliner knows to use the cell's label in such cases.

In the following commands, words delimited with <> represent the
arguments for which each command prompts.  Note how the use of prefix
arguments changes each command's behavior from insertion at the sibling
level to insertion at the child level.

@ktable @kbd
@item C-c c
Copy <tree> to be the successor of <cell>.
@item C-u C-c c

@end ktable

@cindex mouse, moving trees
If you have mouse support under Hyperbole, you can move entire trees
with mouse clicks.  Click the Assist Key within the indentation to the
left of a cell and you will be prompted for a tree to move.  Double
click the Action Key within the contents of the root cell of the tree to
move and then double click within the root contents of the tree you want
it to follow as a sucessor.

The Koutliner supports copying and moving within a single outline only
right now, so don't try to to move trees across different outline files.
You can, however, copy an outline tree to a non-outline buffer with:

@cindex attribute, no-fill
@cindex cell, no-fill attribute
Set the variable, @code{kotl-mode:refill-flag}, to @samp{t} if you want
moving, promoting, demoting, exchanging, splitting and appending cells
to also automatically refill each cell.  Generally, this is not
recommended since if you happen to move a cell that you carefully
formatted yet forgot to give a `no-fill' property, then your formatting
will be lost.


@node Transposing, Splitting and Appending, Filling, Editing
@subsection  Transposing

The Koutliner move and copy commands rearrange entire trees.  The
following two commands, in contrast, exchange the locations of two
individual cells.

@kindex C-c e
@cindex cell, transposing
@cindex cell, exchanging
@cindex exchanging cells
@cindex transposing cells
@bkbd{C-c e} prompts for two cell addresses and exchanges the cell
locations.

@kindex C-c t
@bkbd{C-c t} does not prompt.  It exchanges the current
and immediatly prior cell, regardless of their levels.  If there is no
prior cell it exchanges the current and next cell.

@cindex cell, mark and point
@kindex M-0 C-c t
@bkbd{M-0 C-c t} exchanges the cells in which point and mark fall.
@bkbd{C-c t} with a non-zero numeric prefix argument, N, moves
the current tree maximally past the next N visible cells.  If there are
fewer visible, it makes the current cell the last cell in the outline.

@subsection  Splitting and Appending

@cindex splitting a cell
@cindex cell, splitting
@kindex C-c s
@kindex C-u C-c s
One cell may be split into two adjacent sibling cells with @bkbd{C-c
s}.  This leaves the cell contents preceding point in the current
cell, minus any trailing whitespace, and moves the contents following
point to a new sibling cell which is inserted into the outline.
@bkbd{C-u C-c s} instead adds the new cell as the first child of the
original cell, rather than as its successor.

All cell attributes in the original cell are propagated to the new one,
aside from the creation attributes and idstamp.

@kindex C-c +
@cindex cell, appending
@cindex appending to a cell
@cindex attribute, no-fill
@cindex cell, no-fill attribute
@bkbd{C-c +} appends the contents of a specified cell to the end of
another cell.  It has no effect on cell attributes, except that if one
cell has a `no-fill' attribute, which prevents all but user requested
filling of a cell, then the cell appended to inherits this property.
This helps maintain any special formatting the appended text may have.

you may use a buffer name or file name from which to insert;
completion is provided for file names only.

@kindex C-u C-x i
The elements from the original buffer are converted into kcells and

same conversion process applies if you invoke @bkbd{M-x kotl-mode
@key{RET}} in a non-koutline buffer or if you perform a generic file import
as described later in this section.

@findex kimport:insert-file-contents
Use @bkbd{M-x kimport:insert-file-contents @key{RET}} to insert an
entire file into the current cell following point.

@findex kimport:file
The outliner supports conversion of three types of files into koutline
files.  You can import a file into an existing koutline,
following the tree at point, or can create a new koutline from the
imported file contents.  @bkbd{M-x kimport:file @key{RET}} selects the
importation type based on the buffer or file name suffix of the file to
import.

@findex kotl-mode
If you want to convert a buffer from some other mode into a koutline and
then want to save the converted buffer back to its original file,
thereby replacing the original format, use @bkbd{M-x kotl-mode @key{RET}}.
Remember that you will lose the old format of the buffer when you do
this.

Use one of the following commands when you need explicit control over
the type of importation used on some text.  With these commands, your
original file remains intact.

@findex kimport:text
@cindex text file
Use @bkbd{M-x kimport:text @key{RET}} and you will be prompted for a text
buffer or file to import and the new koutline buffer or file to create
from its text.  Each paragraph will be imported as a separate cell, with
all imported cells at the same level, since indentation of paragraphs is
presently ignored.  This same command can be used to import the
contents, attributes and level structure of cells from another koutline.

@findex kimport:star-outline
@cindex emacs outline
@cindex star outline
Star outlines are standard emacs outlines where each entry begins with
one or more asterisk characters.  Use @bkbd{M-x kimport:star-outline
@key{RET}} and you will be prompted for the star outline buffer or
file to import and the new koutline buffer or file to create.

@cindex Augment outline
@findex kimport:aug-post-outline
(Skip this if you are unfamiliar with the Augment/NLS system originally
created at SRI.)  Files exported from the Augment system as text often
have alphanumeric statement identifiers on the right side.  You can
import such files while maintaining their outline structure.  Use

some cell, a link to that cell will be inserted where you started.  From
a keyboard, use @bkbd{C-c l} when in a koutline or @bkbd{C-h h k
l} when not in a koutline to insert a klink.  Since klinks are
implicit buttons, you may instead type in the text of the klink just as
you see it in the examples below and it will work exactly as if it had
been entered with the insert link command.

@cindex klink, formats
@noindent
There are basically three forms of klinks:

@table @emph
@cindex internal klink
@cindex klink, internal
@cindex <@@ klink>
@item internal
@samp{<@@ 2b=06>} is an internal klink, since it refers to the koutline in
which it is embedded.  When activated, it jumps to the cell within the
current outline which has permanent id `06' and relative id
`2b'.  @samp{<@@ 06>} does the same thing, as does @samp{<@@ 2b>},
though this latter form will not maintain the link properly if the
cell is moved elsewhere within the outline.  The form,
@samp{<@@ 2b=06 |ben>} additionally sets the view spec of the current
outline back to the default value, with a blank line between each cell
and the whole outline visible.

@cindex external klink
@cindex klink, external
@item external
The second klink format is an external link to another koutline, such
as, @samp{<EXAMPLE.kotl, 3=012 |c1e>}, which displays the named file,
starting at the cell 3 (whose permanent identifer is 012), with the
view specification of: blank lines turned off, cutoff after one line
per cell, and showing ellipses for cells or trees which are collapsed.

@cindex klink, view spec
@cindex view spec klink
@item view spec
The third format sets a view spec for the current koutline.  For
example, @samp{<|ben>}, when activated, sets the view in the current
outline to display blank lines, to use ellipses after collapsed lines
and to label cells with the alphanumeric style.

@node Cell Attributes, Koutliner History, Links, Koutliner
@section   Cell Attributes

@cindex cell, attribute
@cindex attribute
@dfn{Attributes} are named variables whose values are specific to an
outline cell.  Thus, each cell has its own attribute list.  Every cell
has three standard attributes:

@table @emph
@cindex idstamp attribute
@item idstamp
The permanent id of the cell, typically used in cross-file hyperlinks
that reference the cell.

@cindex creator attribute
@cindex e-mail address
@cindex mail address
@item creator
The e-mail address of the person who created this cell.

@cindex create-time attribute
@cindex cell, creation time
@item create-time
The time at which the cell was created.  This is stored in a form that
allows for easy data comparisons but is displayed in a human readable
format, such as @samp{Jan 28 18:27:59 CST 2016}.
@end table

@kindex C-c C-i
@cindex attribute, adding
@cindex attribute, modifying
@cindex attribute, removing
@bkbd{C-c C-i} is the command to add an attribute to or to modify an
existing attribute of the cell at point.  Think of it as inserting an
attribute value.  To remove an attribute from a cell, set its value to
@samp{nil}.


@cindex attribute, no-fill
@cindex cell, no-fill attribute
@cindex no-fill attribute
The `no-fill' attribute is special.  When set to @samp{t}, it
prevents movement, promotion, demotion, exchange, split or append
commands from refilling the cell, even if the variable,
@code{kotl-mode:refill-flag}, is set to @samp{t}.  It does not prevent
you from invoking explicit commands that refill the cell.
@xref{Filling}.

@kindex C-c h
@kindex C-u C-c h
The attribute lists for the cells in the tree rooted at point may be
inspected by pressing the Assist Key within the contents of a cell.
@bkbd{C-c h} prompts for a cell label and displays the cell's
attributes.  @bkbd{C-u C-c h} prompts for a cell label and shows
the attributes for it and its subtree; use 0 as the kcell id to see
attributes for all visible cells in the outline.

@cindex NLS
@cindex Augment
@cindex Engelbart
Much of the Hyperbole outliner design is based upon concepts pioneered
in the Augment/NLS system, @cite{[Eng84a]}.  Augment treated documents as
a hierarchical set of nodes, called statements, rather than cells.
Every Augment document utilized this intrinsic structure.

@cindex distributed collaboration
@cindex collaboration
The system could rapidly change the view of a document by collapsing,
expanding, generating, clipping, filtering, including or reordering
these nodes.  It could also map individual views to multiple workstation
displays across a network to aid in distributed, collaborative work.

@cindex knowledge transfer
@cindex idea structuring
@cindex cross referencing
These facilities aided greatly in idea structuring, cross-referencing,
and knowledge transfer.  The Koutliner is a start at bringing
these capabilities back into the mainstream of modern computing culture.

Hyperbole includes a complete, advanced rolo system, HyRolo, for
convenient management of hierarchical, record-oriented information.
Most often this is used for contact management but it can quickly be
adapted to most any record-oriented lookup task, for fast retrieval.

Hyperbole buttons may be included within rolo records and then
manually activated whenever their records are retrieved.

@cindex rolo file
@cindex rolo entry
HyRolo manages and searches rolo files.  A @dfn{rolo file} consists of
an optional header which starts and ends with a line of equal signs
(at least three equal signs starting at the beginning of a line),
followed by any non-negative number of rolo records.  You must
manually add a header to any rolo file if you want it to have one.

@noindent
Here is an example of a simple rolo file.  The date at the end is
automatically added by the rolo system whenever a new record is added.

@example
@group
==================================================================
                          PERSONAL ROLO
<Last-Name>, <First>  <Email>        W<Work#>       F<Fax#>

@end group
@end example

We call rolo records, @dfn{entries}.  Entries begin with a delimiter
of one or more `*' characters at the beginning of a line.  Entries may
be arranged in a hierarchy, where child entries start with one more `*'
character than do their parents.  Top-level entries begin with a single
`*'.

Beyond this initial delimiter, entries are completely free-form text.
It is best to use a "lastname, firstname" format, however, when adding
contact entries into a rolo.  Then the rolo system will automatically
keep your entries alphabetized as you enter them.  You'll also be able
to resort the entries if you ever need.  This ordering is what the
rolo will use if you accept the default entry with which it prompts
you when adding a new entry.

Any search done on the rolo scans the full text of each entry.  During
a search, the rolo file header separator lines and anything in between
are appended to the buffer of matched entries before any entries are
retrieved from the file.  Whenever an entry is matched, it and all of
its descendant entries are retrieved.  If your emacs version supports
textual highlighting, each search match is highlighted for quick,
visual location.

@noindent
For example, a search on "Company" could retrieve the following:

@example
@group
==================================================================
                        COMPANY ROLO
==================================================================
*    Company
**     Manager
***      Staffer
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Thus, searching for Company retrieves all listed employees.
Searching for Manager turns up all Staffer entries.

@end group
@end example

A prefix argument used with any of the find commands listed above
limits the search to a maximum number of matches given by the argument.
The search is terminated whenever that number of matches is found.

For any of the above commands that prompt for a name such as Edit or
Add (not the Find commands), you may use the form parent/child to
locate a child entry below a specific parent.  Hence, for a rolo which
looked like so:

@example
@group
*    Company
**     Manager
***      Staffer
@end group
@end example

@noindent
you could refer to the Staffer entry with the following hierarchical
notation, Company/Manager/Staffer.  This hierarchical
notation is not used in search expressions since they search the
entire rolo anyway.  Thus, "Staffer" as a search pattern will find an entry
containing "Staffer" at any level in a hierarchy, like so:

@example
***      Staffer
@end example

The @code{RegexFind} menu item searches the rolo list for all entries 
which contain matches for a given regular expression.  The regular

The @code{WordFind} menu item locates full-word matches so that if you

@samp{production}.  It is also handy for more precise name matching.

@cindex logical rolo searches
The @code{StringFind} menu item has two uses.  It can find all entry
matches for a string or can execute logical queries for more
precise matching.  The format of logical queries is explained here; a
simple parenthesis delimited prefix format is used with the following
logical operators.

forward to successive spans of text which match the search expression.
@bkbd{M-@key{TAB}} @bkbd{@key{SHIFT}-@key{TAB}} or @bkbd{r} move
point backward to earlier matches.  These keys allow you to quickly
find the matching entry of most interest to you if your search

If you want to extend the match expression with some more characters
to find a particular entry, use @bkbd{M-s}.  This performs an
interactive search forward for the match expression.  You may add to
or delete characters from this expression to find different
occurrences or move to the next match with @bkbd{C-s}.
@bkbd{C-r} reverses the direction of the search.

If you would like to search for a specific entry name in the match
buffer, use @bkbd{l} to interactively locate the text immediately
following the entry start delimiter, typically one or more asterisks.
This lets you find entries by last name quickly, eliminating other
matches.  Standard string, @bkbd{C-s}, and regular expression,
@bkbd{C-M-s}, interactive search commands are also available within
the rolo match buffer.

@kindex rolo, a

Single key outlining commands are also available for browsing matches.
If your search matches a large number of entries, use
@bkbd{t} to get a top-level summary of entries.  Only the first
line of each first-level match is shown.  If you want to see an
overview of all the levels, use @bkbd{o} which shows the first line
of every entry level.  If you want an overview of just the first two
levels, @bkbd{C-u 2 o} will work.

Press @bkbd{s} to show (expand) the entry at point.

@section   Rolo Settings

@vindex hyrolo-file-list
@cindex rolo, personal
The files used in any rolo search are given by the
@code{hyrolo-file-list} variable, whose default value is
typically @code{("~/.rolo.otl"}.  Searches scan only your
personal rolo file.  Any entries added to this list should be absolute
filenames.  If a file in the list does not exist or is not readable, it
is skipped.  Files are searched in the order in which they appear in the
list.  In general, you should leave your personal rolo file as the
first entry in the list, since this is the only file to which the Add
command on the rolo menu adds entries.

Hyperbole releases earlier than 4.17 used a different file name for the
personal rolo.  If such a file exists, you will be prompted to rename
it whenever the Rolo system is loaded.

@cindex BBDB
@cindex Big Brother DataBase
If you use the Big Brother DataBase (BBDB) Emacs package to capture
email addresses and store contact information, the rolo automatically
works with it.  If BBDB is loaded before the rolo, then your
@code{bbdb-file} of contacts is added as the second entry in
@code{hyrolo-file-list} and will be searched automatically for any matches by
the rolo find commands.  Presently there is no support for editing
BBDB entries, just finding them.

For finding matches in the BBDB file only, there are the commands
@code{hyrolo-bbdb-fgrep} (string finding) and @code{hyrolo-bbdb-grep}
(regular expression finding).  They may be bound to keys if desired.

@noindent
Below are the rest of the settings available with the rolo:

@vtable @code

@cindex rolo, highlighting matches
@item hyrolo-highlight-face
If textual highlighting is available in your emacs on your current
display type, the rolo uses the value of @code{hyrolo-highlight-face} as
the face which highlights search matches.

@item hyrolo-kill-buffers-after-use
Rolo file buffers are left around after they are searched, on the
assumption that another search is likely to follow within this emacs
session.  You may wish to change this behavior with the following
setting: @code{(setq hyrolo-kill-buffers-after-use t)}.

@item hyrolo-save-buffers-after-use
After an entry is killed, the modified rolo file is automatically
saved.  If you would rather always save files yourself, use this
setting: @code{(setq hyrolo-save-buffers-after-use nil)}.

@item hyrolo-email-format
When an entry is being added from within a mail reader buffer, the
rolo extracts the sender's name and e-mail address and prompts you
with the name as a default.  If you accept the default, it will enter
the name and the email address using the format given by the
@code{hyrolo-email-format} variable.  See its documentation if you want to
change its value.

@item hyrolo-hdr-regexp
A rolo file may begin with an optional header section which is copied
to the match display buffer whenever any matches are found during a
search.  The start and end lines of this header are controlled by the
regular expression variable, @code{hyrolo-hdr-regexp}, whose default value
is "^===".  This allows lines of all equal signs to visually separate
matching entries retrieved from multiple files during a single search.

@item hyrolo-entry-regexp
The rolo entry start delimiter is given by the regular expression
variable, @code{hyrolo-entry-regexp}, whose default value is "^\*+", i.e.@: 
one or more asterisks at the beginning of a line.

@item hyrolo-display-format-function
When a rolo search is done, each matching entry is passed through the
function given by the variable, @code{hyrolo-display-format-function},
before it is displayed.  This should be a function of one argument,
namely the matching rolo entry as a string.  The string that this
function returns is what is displayed in the rolo match buffer.  The
default function used is @code{identity} which passes the string through
unchanged.  If you use the rolo code to search other kinds of
record-oriented data, this variable can be used to format each entry
however you would like to see it displayed.  With a little experience,
you can quickly write functions that use local bindings of the rolo
entry and file settings to search all kinds of record-oriented data.
There is never a need to learn a complicated query language.

@node Window Configurations, Developing with Hyperbole, HyRolo, Top
@chapter Window Configurations

@cindex window configurations
@cindex restoring windows
@cindex saving window configurations
@vindex file, hywconfig.el
Hyperbole includes the @file{hywconfig.el} library which lets you save and
restore window configurations, i.e@. the layout of windows and buffers
displayed within an emacs frame.  This is useful to save a particular
working context and then to jump back to it at a later time during an
emacs session.  It is also useful during demonstrations to display many
informational artifacts all at once, e.g.@: all of the windows for a
particular subsystem.  None of this information is stored between emacs
sessions, so your window configurations will last through only a single
session of use.  Each window configuration is tied to the emacs frame
in which it is created.

The hywconfig library offers two independent ways of managing window
configurations.  The first way associates a name with each stored
window configuration.  The name may then be used to retrieve the window
configuration later.  The second way uses a ring structure to save
window configurations and then allows cycling through the ring of
saved configurations, finally wrapping around to the first entry after
the last entry is encountered.  Simply stop when the desired
configuration is displayed.

The Win/ menu entry on the Hyperbole top-level menu displays a menu of
window configuration commands:

@end group
@end example

The easiest method is to save and restore window configurations by
name, but it requires that you input the chosen name from the
keyboard.  Alternately, the ring commands permit saves and restores
using only the mouse, if desired.  An earlier chapter (@pxref{Smart
Keys}) mentions how to save and restore window configurations with the
Smart Keys.  Since the ring commands are a bit more complex than their
by-name counterparts, the following paragraphs explain them in more
detail.

@vindex kill-ring
HyWconfig creates a ring structure that operates just like the Emacs
@code{kill-ring} (@pxref{Kill Ring,,,emacs,the Emacs Manual}) but its
elements are window configurations rather than text regions.  You can
add an element to the ring to save the current window configuration in
the selected frame.  After several elements are in the ring, you can
walk through all of them in sequence until the desired configuration
is restored.

@findex hywconfig-ring-save
SaveRing executes the @code{hywconfig-ring-save} command which
saves the current window configuration to the ring.

@findex hywconfig-yank-pop
YankRing executes the @code{hywconfig-yank-pop} command.  It restores
the window configuration currently pointed to within the ring.  It
does not delete this configuration from the ring but it does move the
pointer to the prior ring element.  Repeated calls to this command
thus restore successive window configurations until the ring pointer
wraps around.  Simply stop when a desired configuration appears and
use @bkbd{q} to quit from the minibuffer menu.

@findex hywconfig-delete-pop
PopRing calls the @code{hywconfig-delete-pop} command.  It is used to
restore a previously saved configuration and to delete it from the ring.
Simply stop when a desired configuration appears and use @bkbd{q} to
quit from the minibuffer menu.

@vindex hywconfig-ring-max
The maximum number of elements the ring can hold is set by the
@code{hywconfig-ring-max} variable whose default is 10.  Any saves beyond
this value will delete the oldest element in the ring before a new one
is added.

@section   Hook Variables

@cindex variables
@cindex hook variables
Hyperbole supplies a number of hook variables that allow you to adjust
its basic operations to meet your own needs, without requiring you to
change the code for those operations.

@findex add-hook
We find it best to always set the value of hook variables either to
@samp{nil} or to a list of function names of no arguments, each of which
will be called in sequence when the hook is triggered.  If you use
the @code{add-hook} function to adjust the value of hooks, it will do
this automatically for you.

Given the name of a function, a Hyperbole hook variable triggered within
that function has the same name as the function with a @samp{-hook}
appended.  Hyperbole includes the following hook variables:

@vtable @code

@item hyperbole-init-hook
For customization at Hyperbole initialization time.  Use this to load
any personal Hyperbole type definitions or key bindings you might have.
It is run after Hyperbole support code is loaded but before Hyperbole is
initialized, i.e. prior to keyboard and mouse bindings.

@vindex hbut:current
@item action-act-hook
Run before each Hyperbole button activation.
The variable @code{hbut:current} contains the button to be activated when
this is run.

@item ebut-create-hook
Adds to the Hyperbole explicit button creation process.

@item ebut-delete-hook
Adds to the Hyperbole explicit button deletion process.

@item ebut-modify-hook
Executed when an explicit button's attributes are modified.

@item hibtypes-begin-load-hook
Executed prior to loading of standard Hyperbole implicit button types.
Used to load site-specific low priority implicit button types since
lowest priority ibtypes are loaded first.

@item hibtypes-end-load-hook
Executed after loading of standard Hyperbole implicit button types.
Used to load site-specific high priority implicit button types since
highest priority ibtypes are loaded last.

@item htype-create-hook
Executed whenever a Hyperbole type (e.g.@: action type or implicit button
type) is added to the environment.

@item htype-delete-hook
Executed whenever a type is deleted from the environment.

@item kotl-mode-hook
Executed whenever a koutline is created or read in or when kotl-mode is
invoked.

@item hyrolo-add-hook
Executed after the addition of a new rolo entry.

@item hyrolo-display-hook
Executed when rolo matches are displayed.

@item hyrolo-edit-hook
Executed after point is successfully moved to an entry to be edited.

@item hyrolo-mode-hook
Executed when a rolo match buffer is created and put into hyrolo-mode.

@cindex yank, reformatting
@item hyrolo-yank-reformat-function
A variable whose value may be set to a function of two arguments, START
and END, which give the region of the rolo entry yanked into the
current buffer by the hyrolo-yank command.  The function may reformat this
region to meet user-specific needs.

@end vtable

@noindent
Hyperbole also makes use of a number of standard Emacs hook variables.

@vtable @code

@cindex button highlighting
@item find-file-hook
This is called whenever a file is read into a buffer.  Hyperbole uses
it to highlight any buttons within files.

@cindex button data saving
@item write-file-hooks
This is called whenever a buffer is written to a file.  Hyperbole uses
it to save modified button attributes associated with any file from the
same directory as the current file.

@cindex mail hooks
@cindex news hooks
Hyperbole mail and news facilities also utilize a number of Emacs hook
variables.  These hide button data and highlight buttons if possible.
See the Hyperbole files with `mail' and `gnus' in their names for
specific usage of such hooks.
@end vtable

@section   Creating Types

@cindex type definition
@cindex type redefinition
@noindent
To define or redefine a single Hyperbole type, you may either:

@itemize @bullet
@kindex C-M-x
@findex eval-defun
@kindex C-x C-e
@findex eval-last-sexp
@item
move your Emacs point to within the type definition and use
@bkbd{C-M-x} @code{(eval-defun)} (only works in Emacs Lisp mode);

@item
or move your point to the end of the last line of the type definition and
use @bkbd{C-x C-e} @code{(eval-last-sexp)} (works in most modes).
@end itemize

@cindex Hyperbole types
@vindex class, htype
The functions from the @samp{htype} class may be applied to any
Hyperbole types, if needed.

@vindex file, hactypes.el
@vindex file, hibtypes.el
The following subsections explain the specifics of Hyperbole type
definitions which are beyond standard practice for Emacs Lisp programming.
See the definitions of the standard types in @file{hactypes.el}
and @file{hibtypes.el} for examples.

@node Action Type Creation, Implicit Button Types, Creating Types, Creating Types
@subsection  Action Type Creation

@findex actype:create
@vindex file, hactypes.el
@vindex file, hbut.el
New forms of explicit buttons may be created by adding new action types
to a Hyperbole environment.  The file, @file{hactypes.el}, contains
many examples of working action types.

@cindex action type, creation
@findex defact
@findex actype:create
An action type is created, i.e.@: loaded into the Hyperbole environment,
with the @code{(defact)} function (which is an alias for
@code{(actype:create)}).  The calling signature for this function is
given in its documentation; it is the same as that of @code{(defun)}
except that a documentation string is required.  (An interactive calling
form is also required if the action type has formal parameters and is to
be used in explicit button definitions.  Implicit buttons never use an
action type's interactive form.  It is good practice to include an
interactive form since the type creator cannot know how users may choose
to apply the type.)

An action type's parameters are used differently than those of a
function being called.  Its interactive calling form is used to prompt
for type-specific button attributes whenever an explicit button is
created.  The rest of its body is used when a button with this action
type is activated.  Then the button attributes together with the action
type body are used to form an action that is executed in response to the
button activation.  The action's result is returned to the action caller
unless it returns @samp{nil}, in which case @samp{t} is returned to the
caller to ensure that it registers the performance of the action.

An action type body may perform any computation that uses Emacs Lisp and
Hyperbole functions.

@cindex interactive form
@findex interactive
The interactive calling form for an action type is of the same form as
that of a regular Emacs Lisp function definition (see the documentation
for the Emacs Lisp @code{(interactive)} form).  It may additionally use
Hyperbole command character extensions when the form is given as a
string.  Each such extension character @emph{must} be preceded by a plus
sign, @samp{+}, in order to be recognized, since such characters may also
have standard interactive meanings.

@noindent
The present Hyperbole extension characters are:

@table @code
@cindex argument, Info node
@cindex interactive cmd char, +I
@item +I
Prompts with completion for an existing Info (filename)nodename.

@cindex argument, kcell
@cindex argument, koutline
@cindex interactive cmd char, +K
@item +K
Prompts for an existing kcell identifier, either a full outline level
identifier or a permanent idstamp.

@cindex argument, klink
@cindex interactive cmd char, +L
@item +L
Prompts for a klink specification.  See the documentation for the function
@code{(kcell-view:reference)} for details of the format of a klink.

@cindex interactive cmd char, +M
@cindex argument, mail message
@item +M
Prompts for a mail message date and the file name in which it resides.
The mail parameters prompted for by this character code may change in
the future.

@cindex argument, view spec
@cindex interactive cmd char, +V
@item +V
Prompts for a Koutliner view specification string, with the current
view spec, if any, as a default.

@cindex argument, Info index item
@cindex interactive cmd char, +X
@item +X
Prompts with completion for an existing Info index (filename)itemname.

@end table

@vindex class, hargs
@cindex argument, reading
Arguments are read by the functions in Hyperbole's @code{hargs} class,
rather than the standard Lisp @code{read} functions, in order to allow
direct selection of arguments via the Action Key.

If an action type create is successful, the symbol that Hyperbole uses
internally to reference the type is returned.  On failure, @samp{nil} is
returned so that you may test whether or not the operation succeeds.

Once you have defined an action type within your present Hyperbole
environment, you can create new explicit buttons which use it.  There is
no explicit button type beyond its action type, so no other work is
necessary.

@findex actype:delete
Call @code{(actype:delete)} to remove an action type from a Hyperbole
environment.  It takes a single parameter which should be the same type
symbol used in the type definition call (not the Hyperbole symbol
returned by the call).

@node Implicit Button Types,  , Action Type Creation, Creating Types
@subsection  Implicit Button Types

@cindex implicit button type
@cindex ibtype
@findex defib
@findex ibtype:create
An implicit button type is created or loaded via the @code{(defib)}
function (which is an alias for @code{(ibtype:create)}).  The calling
signature for this function is given in its documentation; it is the
same as that of @code{(defun)}, but with a number of constraints.  The
parameter list should always be empty since no parameters will be used.
A documentation string is required; it is followed by the body of the
type.

@cindex ibtype, predicate
@cindex ibtype, argument
@cindex ibtype, return val
@cindex ibtype, actype
The body of an implicit button type is a predicate which determines
whether or not point is within an implicit button of the type.  If not,
the predicate returns @samp{nil}.  If so, it may optionally setup to
flash the button and then to perform one or more actions.  A call of the
form: @code{(ibut:label-set label start-pos end-pos)} is used to setup
the button flashing, if desired.  This is then typically immediately
followed by an action invocation of the form:
@code{(hact 'actype &rest actype-arguments)}.  It is imperative that all
actions (non-predicate code) be invoked through the @code{(hact)}
function or your ibtypes will not work properly.  (Hyperbole first tests
to see if any ibtype matches the current context before activating any
type, so it ensures that @code{(hact)} calls are disabled during this
testing.)  Any action types used in the definition of an implicit button
type may be created before or after the definition, but obviously, must
be defined before any implicit buttons of the given type are activated;
an error will result, otherwise.

If an implicit button type create is successful, the symbol that
Hyperbole uses internally to reference the type is returned.  On
failure, @samp{nil} is returned so that you may test whether or not the
operation succeeds.  Implicit button type names and action type names
may be the same without any conflict.  In fact, such naming is
encouraged when an implicit button type is the exclusive user of an
action type.

@findex ibtype:delete
Call @code{(ibtype:delete)} to remove an implicit button type from a
Hyperbole environment.  It takes a single parameter which should be the
same type symbol used in the type definition call (not the Hyperbole
symbol returned by the call).  This will not delete the action type used
by the implicit button; that must be done separately.

@cindex ibtype, help
@findex ibut:at-p
@vindex class, hattr
@vindex class, hbut
@vindex file, hib-kbd.el
By default, a request for help on an implicit button will display the
button's attributes in the same manner as is done for explicit buttons.
For some implicit button types, other forms of help will be more
appropriate.  If an Emacs Lisp function is defined whose name is formed
from the concatenation of the type name followed by @samp{:help}, e.g.@:
@code{my-ibtype:help}, it is used to respond to requests for
help on buttons of that type.  Any such function should take a single
argument of an implicit button construct.  (This is what
@code{(ibut:at-p)} returns when point is within an implicit button
context.)  The button may be queried for its attributes using functions
from the @samp{hbut} and @samp{hattr} classes.  See the @file{hib-kbd.el}
file for an example of a custom help function.

@node Button Label Normalization, Operational and Storage Formats, Explicit Button Technicalities, Explicit Button Technicalities
@subsection  Button Label Normalization
@cindex normalized label
@cindex button label
@cindex button key
@vindex hbut:label-to-key
Hyperbole uses a normalized form of button labels called button keys (or
label keys) for all internal operations.  See the documentation for the
function @code{(hbut:label-to-key)} for details of the normalization
process.  The normalized form permits Hyperbole to recognize buttons that
are the same but whose labels appear different from one another, due to
text formatting conventions.  For example, all of the following would
be recognized as the same button.

@example
  <(fake button)>     <( fake      button)>

  Pam>  <(fake
  Pam>    button)>

  ;; <(fake
  ;;   button)>

  /* <( fake      */
  /*    button )> */
@end example

@vindex hbut:fill-prefix-regexps
@vindex fill-prefix
@cindex fill prefix
@cindex button, multiple lines
@cindex button, split across lines
The last three examples demonstrate how Hyperbole ignores common fill
prefix patterns that happen to fall within the middle of a button label
that spans multiple lines.  As long as such buttons are selected with
point at a location within the label's first line, the button will be
recognized.  The variable @code{hbut:fill-prefix-regexps} holds the list
of fill prefixes recognized when embedded within button labels.  All
such prefixes are recognized (one per button label), regardless of the
setting of the Emacs variable, @code{fill-prefix}, so no user
intervention is required.

@node Operational and Storage Formats, Programmatic Button Creation, Button Label Normalization, Explicit Button Technicalities
@subsection  Operational and Storage Formats

@cindex explicit button, formats
@cindex explicit button, storage
@cindex storage manager
@cindex button attributes
@vindex hbut:current
Hyperbole uses a terse format to store explicit buttons and a more
meaningful one to show users and to manipulate during editing.  The
terse format consists solely of button attribute values whereas the edit
format includes an attribute name with each attribute value.  A button
in edit format consists of a Lisp symbol together with its attribute list
which holds the attribute names and values.  In this way, buttons may be
passed along from function to function simply by passing the symbol to
which the button is attached.  Most functions utilize the pre-defined
@code{hbut:current} symbol by default to store and retrieve the last
encountered button in edit format.

@vindex class, hbdata
@vindex class, ebut
@vindex class, hbut
The @samp{hbdata} class handles the terse, stored format.  The
@samp{hbut}, @samp{ebut}, and @samp{ibut} classes work with the
name/value format.  This separation permits the wholesale replacement of
the storage manager with another, with any interface changes hidden from
any Hyperbole client programming.

@node Programmatic Button Creation,  , Operational and Storage Formats, Explicit Button Technicalities
@subsection  Programmatic Button Creation

@cindex explicit button, creation
A common need when developing with Hyperbole is to create or to modify
explicit buttons without user interaction.  For example, an application
might require the addition of an explicit summary button to a file for
each new mail message a user reads that contains a set of keywords.  The
user could then check the summary file and jump to desired messages
quickly.

@vindex class, ebut
@vindex file, hbut.el
@findex ebut:create
@findex ebut:map
The Hyperbole class @samp{ebut} supports programmatic access to explicit
buttons.  Examine it within the @file{hbut.el} file for full details.
The documentation for @code{(ebut:create)} explains the set of
attributes necessary to create an explicit button.  For operations over
the whole set of buttons within the visible (non-narrowed) portion of a
buffer, use the @code{(ebut:map)} function.


@node Encapsulating Systems, Embedding Hyperbole, Explicit Button Technicalities, Developing with Hyperbole
@section   Encapsulating Systems

@vindex file, hsys-*
@cindex Hyperbole, system encapsulation
@cindex system encapsulation
A powerful use of implicit button types is to provide a Hyperbole-based
interface to external systems.  The basic idea is to interpret patterns
output by the application as implicit buttons.

See the @file{hsys-*} files for examples of how to do this.
Encapsulations are provided for the following systems (the systems
themselves are not included with Hyperbole):

@table @emph
@item World-Wide Web
The world-wide web system originally developed at CERN, that now spans
the Internet universe.  This is automatically loaded by Hyperbole so
that a press of the Action Key follows a URL.

@node Embedding Hyperbole,  , Encapsulating Systems, Developing with Hyperbole
@section   Embedding Hyperbole

[NOTE: We have never done this ourselves, though we have done similar
things which leads us to infer that the task should not be difficult.]

@cindex Hyperbole API
@cindex API
@cindex programming interface
@cindex Hyperbole, embedding
The standard Hyperbole user interface has purposely been separated from
the Hyperbole backend to support the development of alternative
interfaces and the embedding of Hyperbole functionality within other
system prototypes.  The Hyperbole backend functionality that system
developers can make use of is called its Application Programming
Interface (API).  The API may be used to make server-based calls to
Hyperbole when Emacs is run as a non-interactive (batch) process, with
its input/output streams attached to another process.

The public functions and variables from the following files may be
considered the present Hyperbole API:

@noindent
@file{hact.el}, @file{hargs.el}, @file{hbmap.el}, @file{hbut.el},
@file{hhist.el}, @file{hmail.el}, @file{hmoccur.el}, @file{hpath.el},
@file{htz.el}, @file{hypb.el}, @file{hyrolo.el}, @file{hyrolo-logic.el},
@file{hywconfig.el} andn @file{set.el}.


@noindent
Note when looking at these files, that they are divided into sections
that separate one data abstraction (class) from another.  A line of
dashes within a class separates public parts of the class from the
private parts that follow the line.

This API does not include the Hyperbole outliner, as it has been
designed for interactive use, rather than programmatic extensibility.
You are welcome, however, to study its code, below the
@file{hyperbole-$@{hyperb:version@}/kotl/} directory.


@node Glossary, Setup, Developing with Hyperbole, Top
@appendix Glossary

@cindex glossary
@cindex definitions
Concepts pertinent to operational usage of Hyperbole are defined here.
@xref{Glossary,,,emacs,the Emacs Manual},
if any emacs-related terms are unfamiliar to you.

@table @b

@item Action
An executable behavior associated with a Hyperbole button.  @dfn{Links}
are a specific class of actions which display existing entities, such as
files. See also @b{Action Type}.

@item Action Key
See @b{Smart Key}.

@item Action Type
A behavioral specification for use within Hyperbole buttons.  Action
types usually contain a set of parameters which must be given values for
each button with which they are associated.  An action type together
with a set of values, called arguments, is an @dfn{action}.
@dfn{Actype} is a synonym for action type.

@item Activation
A request to a Hyperbole button to perform its action.
Ordinarily the user presses a key which selects and activates a button.

@item Ange-ftp
See @b{Tramp}.

@item Argument
A button-specific value fed to a Hyperbole type specification when the
button is activated.

@item Assist Key
See @b{Smart Key}.

@item Attribute
A named parameter slot associated with a category or type of Hyperbole
button.  An @emph{attribute value} is typically specific to a particular
button instance.

@cindex Augment
@cindex hypertext
@cindex interactive computing
@cindex mouse
@cindex windows
@cindex hypertext
@cindex outline processor
@cindex groupware
@cindex digital signature
@cindex Engelbart
@item Augment
The Augment system, originally named NLS, was a pioneering research and
production system aimed at augmenting human intellect and group knowledge
processing capabilities through integrated tools and organizational
development strategies.  This approach led to the invention of much of
interactive computing technology decades ahead of other efforts, including:
the mouse, chord keyboards, screen windows, true hypertext, outline
processors, groupware, and digitally signed documents.
@xref{References}, which cites several Douglas Engelbart papers on the
subject.  The Koutliner demonstrates a few of the concepts pioneered in
Augment.

@item Buffer
An Emacs buffer is an editable or viewable text, possibly with special
formatting such as an outline or table.  It may also be attached to a
process, receiving and updating its text as the process handles
changing information.

@item Button
A selectable Hyperbole construct which performs an action.  A button
consists of a set of attributes that includes: a textual label, a
category, a type and zero or more arguments.  @emph{Explicit buttons}
also have creator, create time, last modifier, and last modifier time
attributes.

Buttons provide user gateways to information.  Users see and
interact with button labels; the rest of the button attributes are
managed invisibly by Hyperbole and displayed only in response to user
queries.

@item Button Activation
See @b{Activation}.

@item Button Attributes
See @b{Attributes}.

@item Button Data
Lists of button attribute values explicitly saved and managed by Hyperbole.
One list for each button created by Hyperbole.

@item Button File, local
A per-directory file named @file{HYPB} that may be used to store any
buttons that link to files within the directory.  It may be displayed
via a menu selection whenever a user is within the directory.

@item Button File, personal
A per-user file named @file{HYPB} that stores all global buttons for the
user and any other buttons used to navigate to other information spaces.
It may be displayed via a menu selection at any time.

@item Button Key
A normalized form of a @b{button label} used internally by Hyperbole.

@item Button Label
A text string that visually indicates a Hyperbole button location and
that serves as its name and unique identifier.  Within a buffer, buttons
with the same label are considered separate views of the same button and
so behave exactly alike.  Since button labels are simply text strings,
they may be embedded within any text to provide non-linear information
or operational access points.

@vindex ebut:max-len
The maximum length of a button label is limited by the variable
@code{ebut:max-len}.

@item Button Selection
The act of designating a Hyperbole button upon which to operate.
Use the Action Key to select a button.

@item Category
A class of Hyperbole buttons: implicit, explicit or global.

@item Cell
See @code{Kcell}.

@item Children
The set of koutline cells which share a common parent cell and thus, are one
level deeper than the parent.

@item Chord Keyboard
A keyboard which supports pressing multiple keys simultaneously to produce
a unique chord keystroke for issuing commands to a program.  In Engelbart's
Augment system, mouse keys were used as modifiers for a 5-key chord
keyboard to enable direct manipulation of objects on screen.  Hyperbole
supports similar behavior with its @code{hmouse-mod-mode}.  @xref{Smart Key
Modifiers}.

@item Class
A group of functions and variables with the same prefix in their names,
used to provide an interface to an internal or external Hyperbole
abstraction.

@item Context
A programmatic or positional state recognized by Hyperbole.
We speak of Smart Key and implicit button contexts.  Both are typically
defined in terms of surrounding patterns within a buffer, but may be
defined by arbitrary Emacs Lisp predicates.

@item Display
See @b{Screen}.

@item Domain
The contexts in which an implicit button type may be found, i.e.@: where
its predicate is true.

@item Drag
A mouse button press in one location and following release in another
location.

@item Environment
See @b{Hyperbole Environment}.

@item EFS
See @b{Tramp}

@item Explicit Button
A button created and managed by Hyperbole, associated with a specific
action type.  By default, explicit buttons are delimited like
this @samp{<(fake button)>}.  Direct selection is used to operate upon
an explicit button.

@item Frame
An Emacs frame displays one or more Emacs windows and widgets
(menubars, toolbars, scrollbars).  Under a graphical window system,
this is a single window system window.  On a dumb terminal, only one
frame is visible at a time as each frame generally fills the whole
terminal display, providing a virtual screen capability.  Emacs
windows exist within a frame.

@item Global Button
@vindex gbut:file
A form of explicit button which is accessed by name rather than direct
selection.  Global buttons are useful when one wants quick access to
actions such as jumping to common file locations or for performing
sequences of operations.  One need not locate them since they are always
available by name, with full completion offered.  All global buttons are
stored in the file given by the variable @code{gbut:file} and may be
activated as regular explicit buttons by visiting this file.  By
default, this is the same as the user's personal button file.

@item Global Button File
See @b{Button File, personal} and @b{Global Button}.

@findex run-hooks
@item Hook Variable
A variable that permits customization of an existing function's
operation without the need to edit the function's code.  See also the
documentation for the function @code{(run-hooks)}.

@item HyControl
HyControl, the Hyperbole window and frame control manager, offers
fast, single key manipulation of window and frame creation, deletion,
sizing, position and face zooming (enlarging/shrinking).

@item Hyperbole
The flexible, programmable information management and viewing system
documented by this manual.  It utilizes a button-action model and supports
hypertextual linkages.  Hyperbole is all things to all people.

@item Hyperbole Environment
A programmatic context within which Hyperbole operates.  This includes
the set of Hyperbole types defined and the set of Hyperbole code modules
loaded.  It does not include the set of accessible buttons.
Although the entire Emacs environment is available to Hyperbole, we do
not speak of this as part of the Hyperbole environment.

@item Hypertext
A text or group of texts which may be explored in a non-linear fashion
through associative linkages embedded throughout the text.  Instead of
simply referring to other pieces of work, hypertext references when
followed actually take you to the works themselves.

@item HyRolo
HyRolo, the Hyperbole record/contact manager, provides rapid lookup of
multi-line, hierarchically ordered free form text records.  It can
also lookup records from the Big Brother DataBase (BBDB) package.

@item Implicit Button
A button recognized contextually by Hyperbole.  Such buttons contain no
button data.  See also @b{implicit button type}.

@item Implicit Button Type
A specification of how to recognize and activate implicit buttons of a
specific kind.  Implicit button types often utilize structure internal
to documents created and managed by tools other than Hyperbole, for
example, programming documentation.  @b{Ibtype} is a synonym for
implicit button type.  See also @b{system encapsulation}.

@cindex InfoDock
@item InfoDock
InfoDock is an integrated productivity toolset for software engineers
and knowledge workers.  It is presently built atop XEmacs and is no
longer maintained.  An older version from 1999 may be found at
infodock.sf.net.  InfoDock has all the power of emacs, but with an
easier to use and more comprehensive menu-based user interface.  Most
objections people raise to using emacs have already been addressed in
InfoDock.  InfoDock is for those people who want a complete,
pre-customized environment in one package.

@item Instance Number
A colon prefaced number appended to the label of a newly created button
when the button's label duplicates the label of an existing button in
the current buffer.  This number makes the label unique and so allows
any number of buttons with the same base label within a single buffer.

@item Koutline
A hierarchically ordered grouping of cells which may be stored as a file
and viewed and edited as an outline.

@item Koutliner
Koutliner, the Hyperbole outliner, is a powerful autonumbering outliner
with permanent hypertext anchors for easy hyperlinking and view
specs for rapid outline view alteration.

@item Kcell
Cells or kcells are elements within koutlines.  Each cell may contain
textual and graphical contents, a relative identifier, a permanent
identifier and a set of attributes such as the user who created the cell
and the time of creation.  See also @b{Koutliner}.

@item Link
A reference from a Hyperbole button to an existing (non-computed)
entity.  The referenced entity is called a @dfn{referent}.
Links are a subset of the types of actions that Hyperbole buttons
support.

@item Local Button File
See @b{Button File, local}.

@item Minibuffer Window
The one line window at the bottom of a frame where messages and prompts
are displayed.

@item Minibuffer Menu
A Hyperbole menu displayed in the minibuffer window.  Each menu item
within a minibuffer menu begins with a different letter that can be used
to invoke the item (case doesn't matter).  Items that display other
menus end with a forward slash, @samp{/}.

@item Mouse Key
@itemx Mouse Button
See @b{Smart Key}.

@item NLS
See @b{Augment}.

@item Node
See @b{Link} or @b{Cell}.

@item The OO-Browser
The OO-Browser is a multi-windowed, interactive object-oriented class browser
similar in use to the well-known Smalltalk browsers.  It runs inside Emacs.
It is unique in a number of respects foremost of which is that it works well
with most major object-oriented languages in use today.  You can switch from
browsing in one language to another in a few seconds.  It provides both
textual views within an editor and graphical views under the X window system
and Windows.  It includes support for C, C++, Common Lisp and its Object
System (CLOS), Eiffel, Java, Objective-C, Python and Smalltalk.

@item Outline
See @b{Koutline}.

@item Parent
Any koutline cell which has children.

@item Predecessor
The previous same level koutline cell with the same parent.

@item Predicate
A boolean (@samp{nil} = false, non-nil = true = @samp{t}) Lisp
expression typically evaluated as part of a conditional expression.
Implicit button types contain predicates that determine whether or not a
button of that type is to be found at point.

@item Referent
See @b{Link}.

@item Remote Pathname
A file or directory on a system not shared within the local area network.
The built-in Emacs library, @b{Tramp}, handles remote pathnames and
Hyperbole uses it to enable viewing and editing of remote paths of the form:
@file{/<user>@@<host>:<path>} as well as web URLs.  Use the
Cust/Find-File-URLs menu option to enable this feature.

@item Rolo
See @b{HyRolo}.

@item Root Cell
A koutline cell which has cells below it at lower outline levels.  All
such cells share the same root cell.

@cindex Screen
@item Screen
The total display area available to Emacs frames.  This may consist of
multiple physical monitors arranged into a single virtual display.
Screen edges are thus the outer borders of the virtual display.

@cindex Smart Key
@vindex smart-scroll-proportional
@cindex proportional scrolling
@cindex middle mouse key
@cindex scrolling
@vindex hmouse-middle-flag
@item Smart Key
A context-sensitive key used within Hyperbole and beyond.  There are
two Smart Keys, the Action Key and the Assist Key.  The Action Key,
bound to the shift-middle mouse key (or shift-left mouse key on a
2-button mouse), activates Hyperbole buttons and scrolls the current
buffer line to the top of the window when pressed at the end of a
line.  (InfoDock users or those who set the variable,
@code{hmouse-middle-flag}, to @samp{t}, may also use the middle mouse
key as the Action Key).


The Assist Key, bound to the shift-right mouse key, explains
what a Hyperbole button does or scrolls the current line to the bottom
of the window when pressed at the end of a line.  (Use the Hyperbole
Cust menu or see the documentation for the variable,
@code{smart-scroll-proportional}, for information on how to make these
keys scroll forward and backward a windowful at a time).

To see what a Smart Key will do within a particular context, depress and
hold the Smart Mouse Key at the point desired and depress the other
Smart Mouse Key.  A buffer containing a description of its contextual
function will then be displayed.  You may release the two keys in any
order after you have depressed them both.

@kindex C-h A
@kindex C-u C-h A
@cindex key binding, C-h A
@cindex key binding, C-u C-h A
@bkbd{C-h A} displays this same context-sensitive help for the
Action Key while @bkbd{C-u C-h A} displays the help for the Assist
Key.  Note that @bkbd{C-h a} performs a function unrelated to
Hyperbole, so you must press the shift key when you type the @bkbd{A}
character.

The Doc/SmartKeys menu item displays a summary of Smart Key functions in
each context.

@item Source Buffer / File
The buffer or file within which a Hyperbole button is embedded.

@item Subtree
All of the cells in a koutline which share the same root cell, excluding
the root cell.

@item Successor
The next same level koutline cell which follows the current cell and
shares the same parent.

@item System Encapsulation
Use of Hyperbole to provide an improved or consistent user
interface to another system.  Typically, implicit button types are
defined to recognize and activate button-type constructs managed by the
other system.

@item Tramp
A remote file access library built-in to Emacs.  It does similar things as
the older EFS and ange-ftp packages but uses more secure transfer and works
with more types of hosts.  It allows one to use remote pathnames that are
accessible via Internet protocols just like other pathnames, for example when
finding a file.  Hyperbole recognizes pathnames of the form,
@file{/<user>@@<host>:<path>} and web URLs.

@item Tree
The set of cells in a koutline that share a common root cell, including
the root cell.

@item URL
A Universal Resource Locator specification used on the World-Wide web
to access documents and services via a multiplicity of protocols.

@item View
A perspective on some information.  A view can affect the extent of the
information displayed, its format, modes used to operate on it, its
display location and so forth.

@item View Spec
A terse (and to the uninitiated, cryptic) string that specifies a
particular view of a koutline or a link referent.  If a view spec is
active for a buffer, the view spec appears within the modeline like so,
<|view spec>.

@item Window
An Emacs window displays a single Emacs buffer within a single frame.
Frames may contain many windows.

@cindex installation
Hyperbole must be obtained and setup at your site before you can
use it.  Instructions are given below.  If you are using InfoDock
version 4.0.7 or higher, Hyperbole is pre-installed so you may skip
the installation instructions and simply continue with the
invocation instructions in this appendix.

@menu

* Invocation::
* Configuration::
@end menu

@node Installation, Invocation, Setup, Setup
@section   Installation

@cindex obtaining Hyperbole
@cindex Hyperbole, obtaining
By far, the simplest and quickest way to install Hyperbole is to use
the Emacs Package Manager.  If you are not familiar with it, see the
Packages section of the GNU Emacs Manual, @pxref{Packages,,,emacs,the
Emacs Manual}.

If you have Hyperbole 5.10 or higher installed and simply want
to upgrade it, invoke the Emacs Package Manager with @bkbd{M-x
list-packages @key{RET}}, then use the @bkbd{U} followed by
the @bkbd{x} key to upgrade all out-of-date packages, Hyperbole
among them.  Then skip the next section and @pxref{Invocation}.

Otherwise, to download and install the Hyperbole package, add the
following lines to your personal Emacs initialization file,
typically @file{~/.emacs} or @file{~/.emacs.d/.emacs},

@smalllisp
(require 'package)
(setq package-check-signature nil
      package-enable-at-startup nil) ;; Prevent double loading of libraries
;; GNU Emacs now includes the Elpa package-archive setting but we include
;; it here as a reference of how to do this.  add-to-list will do nothing
;; it it is already in the list.
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
(unless (package-installed-p 'hyperbole)
  (package-refresh-contents)	
  (package-install 'hyperbole))
(require 'hyperbole)
@end smalllisp

Then restart Emacs and if no errors occur, the latest version of
Hyperbole will be downloaded, installed and available for use.

@noindent
Now read the next section on Invocation.

@node Invocation, Configuration, Installation, Setup
@section   Invocation

Once Hyperbole has been installed for use at your site and loaded into
your Emacs session, it is ready for use.  You will see a Hyperbole
menu on your menubar and @bkbd{C-h h} will display a Hyperbole menu in
the minibuffer for quick keyboard or mouse-based selection.  Select an
item from this menu by typing the item's first letter.  Use @bkbd{q}
to quit from the menu.

@noindent
You can invoke Hyperbole's commands in one of three ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item use the Hyperbole entry on your menubar;

@findex hyperbole
@item type @bkbd{C-h h} or @bkbd{M-x hyperbole @key{RET}} to bring up the Hyperbole minibuffer menu;

@item use a specific Hyperbole command such as the Action Key, @bkbd{M-@key{RET}}, on a pathname to display the associated file or directory.
@end itemize

Use @bkbd{C-h h d d} for an interactive demonstration of standard Hyperbole
button capabilities.

Type @bkbd{C-h h k e} for an interactive demonstration of the Koutliner,
Hyperbole's multi-level autonumbered hypertextual outliner.

To try out HyControl, Hyperbole's interactive frame and window control
system, use @bkbd{C-h h s w} for window control or @bkbd{C-h h s f}
for frame control.  Pressing @bkbd{t} switches between window and
frame control once in HyControl.

@vindex Info-directory-list
@vindex hyperb:dir
@cindex Hyperbole manual
@noindent
The above are the best interactive ways to learn about Hyperbole.  The
Hyperbole Manual is a reference manual, not a simple introduction.  It
is included in the @file{man/} subdirectory of the Hyperbole package
directory in four forms:

@cindex Info manual
@cindex Texinfo manual
@vindex file, man/hyperbole.info
@vindex file, man/hyperbole.html
@vindex file, man/hyperbole.pdf
@vindex file, man/hyperbole.texi
@example
@file{man/hyperbole.info}   - online Info browser version
@file{man/hyperbole.html}   - web HTML version
@file{man/hyperbole.pdf}    - printable version
@file{man/hyperbole.texi}   - source form
@end example

The Hyperbole package installation places the Info version of this
manual where needed and adds an entry for Hyperbole into the Info
directory under the Emacs category.  @bkbd{C-h h d i} will let you
browse the manual.  Then use @bkbd{s} to search for anything
throughout the manual.  For web browsing, point your browser
at @file{@code{$@{hyperb:dir@}}/man/hyperbole.html}, wherever the
Hyperbole package directory is on your system; often this
is: @file{~/.emacs.d/elpa/hyperbole-$@{hyperb:version@}/}.

Generally, you should not need to change anything other than these options.
However, if you like to customize your environment extensively, there
are many additional Hyperbole configuration options that may be 
changed with the Emacs customization interface,
@pxref{Easy Customization,,Easy Customization Interface,emacs, the Emacs Manual}.
When you save any changes within this interface, the changes are saved
permanently to your personal Emacs initialization file and are available
in future Emacs sessions.

@findex customize-browse
Use Cust/All-Options @bkbd{C-h h c a} to display an expandable tree of
customizable Hyperbole options.  Hyperbole's customizations are
further grouped into several sub-categories, one for the Koutliner,
one for the Rolo, etc.  You can select either an entire category or a
specfic option and they will appear in another window for editing.
Simply follow the instructions on screen and then press the ``Apply
and Save'' button to make any changes permanent.

The following sections discuss the configuration options most likely to

@cindex browsing URLs
@cindex URLs, using with find-file
@cindex web pages, displaying
@cindex remote pathnames
Hyperbole always recognizes URLs within buffers when the Action Key is
pressed on them.  But sometimes it is useful to enter a URL at a prompt
and have it displayed.  Hyperbole can recognize ftp and www URLs given to
the @code{find-file} command (or any other @code{find-file-*} commands).
But because there is added overhead with this feature, it is not enabled by
default.

@cindex menu item, Find-File-URLs
@cindex menu item, Find-File-Accepts-URLs
To enable the feature, use the Hyperbole menu item Cust/Find-File-URLs
(or Find-File-Accepts-URLs on the Hyperbole/Customize pulldown
menu).  Either of these toggles acceptance of URLs.  When enabled the
string, URLs, appears in the parenthesized minor-mode section of the
modeline.

@findex hpath:find-file-urls-mode
@cindex enabling URLs in find-file
@cindex browsing URLs in find-file
To enable this feature each time you start the editor, add the following to
your personal initialization file: @code{(hpath:find-file-urls-mode 1)}.

@cindex abbreviated URLs
@cindex URLs, abbreviated
@cindex Tramp
Both full URLs and abbreviated ones, like @file{www.gnu.org}, are
recognized.  File name completion does not work with URLs thus you
have to type or paste in the entire URL.  This feature will work only
if you have the Tramp Emacs Lisp package installed; if you don't have
Tramp, an error message will be displayed when you try to enable
find-file URLs.

@node Internal Viewers, External Viewers, Using URLs with Find-File, Configuration
@subsection  Internal Viewers
@vindex hpath:internal-display-alist
@cindex file display function
@cindex display function
@cindex internal viewer
@cindex link, display function
When given a file name, Hyperbole will by default display the file for
editing within an Emacs buffer.  The @code{hpath:internal-display-alist}
variable can be used to specify file name patterns, such as matching
suffixes, which will invoke a special Emacs Lisp function to display
any matching files within Emacs.  This can be used to format raw data
files for convenient display.

For those who want to change this variable, @code{hpath:internal-display-alist}
is defined in @file{hpath.el}.  Its value is an association list whose
elements are (<file-name-regular-expression> . <function-of-one-arg>)
pairs.  Any path whose name matches a <file-name-regular-expression>
will be displayed by calling the associated <function-of-one-arg> with
the file name as the argument.

By default, this variable handles the following types of files:
@table @emph
@item Audio Files
Major audio format files are played with the @code{play-sound-file} command.
@item Info Manuals
Files with a @file{.info} suffix (may also be compressed) are displayed in the Info browser.
@item RDB Files
Files with an @file{.rdb} suffix are displayed as relational databases using the RDB package
available with InfoDock.

@cindex window system
@cindex external program
@cindex external viewer
@cindex link, viewer program
If you will be using Hyperbole under a window system,
the @code{hpath:get-external-display-alist} function
in @file{hpath.el} supports hyperlinks that open files using external, non-Emacs
tools, e.g.@: a pdf reader or a vector graphic viewer.

The value returned by @code{hpath:get-external-display-alist} is determined
based on the window system supported by the current frame and the version
of Emacs in use.  This value is an association list whose elements are
(<file-name-regular-expression> . <viewer-program-or-list>) pairs.  Any
path whose name matches a <file-name-regular-expression> will be
displayed using the corresponding viewer-program or the first
viewer-program found on the system from a list of programs.  If a
<viewer-program> entry contains a @samp{%s} string, the filename to
display will be substituted at that point within the string.
Otherwise, the filename will be appended to the <viewer-program>
entry.  Alternatively, the viewer-program may be a Lisp function that
takes a single filename argument.

The association lists used by this function are stored in variables
for each available window system: @code{hpath:external-display-alist-macos},
@code{hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows}, and
@code{hpath:external-display-alist-x}.  Examine and modify these
values to suit your needs.

@cindex MIME
@cindex mailcap
@cindex external viewer
On systems that have a MIME mailcap file (see
@file{www.wikiwand.com/en/Mailcap}), this is used as a fallback
set of external viewer associations when none are found
within @code{hpath:get-external-display-alist}.

@subsection Invisible Text Searches

@cindex isearch
@cindex search
This is largely for outline modes such as the Koutliner.  By default,
character-by-character interactive search on @bkbd{C-s} will search
through invisible/hidden text, making the text temporarily visible
until point moves past that hidden part.  When a search match is
selected, the surrounding text remains visible.

This command toggles that setting (turns it off if a prefix
argument less than or equal to 0 is given) and makes searches look at
only visible text.

@node Link Variable Substitution, Button Colors, Invisible Text Searches, Configuration
@subsection  Link Variable Substitution
@vindex hpath:variables
@cindex environment variables
@cindex Emacs Lisp variables
@cindex Lisp variables
Another option to consider modifying is @code{hpath:variables}.  This
option consists of a list of Emacs Lisp variable names, each of which
may have a pathname or a list of pathnames as a value.  Whenever a
Hyperbole file or directory link button is created, its pathname is
compared against the values in @code{hpath:variables}.  The first
match found, if any, is selected and its associated variable name is
substituted into the link pathname, in place of its literal value.
When a link button is activated, potentially at a different site,
Hyperbole replaces each variable within the link pathname with the
first matching value from this list to recreate the literal pathname.
Environment variables are also replaced whenever link paths are
resolved.

This permits sharing of links over wide areas, where the variable values
differ between link creator and link activator.  The entire process
is wholly transparent to the user; it is explained here simply to help
you in deciding whether or not to modify the value of
@code{hpath:variables}.

@node Button Colors,  , Link Variable Substitution, Configuration
@subsection  Configuring Button Colors

@cindex Emacs support
@cindex button highlighting
@cindex button flashing
@vindex file, hui-ep*.el
@vindex file, hsite.el
@findex hproperty:cycle-but-color
When Hyperbole is run under a window system together with InfoDock,
Emacs, or XEmacs, it automatically highlights any explicit buttons in
a buffer and makes them flash when selected.  The main setting you may
want change is the selection of a color (or style) for button
highlighting and button flashing.  See the @file{hui-*-b*.el} files for
lists of potential colors and the code which supports this behavior.  A
call to @code{(hproperty:cycle-but-color)} in the @file{hsite.el} file
changes the color used to highlight and flash explicit buttons.

@cindex button emphasis
@vindex hproperty:but-emphasize-p
Additionally, if @code{hproperty:but-emphasize-p} is set to @samp{t},
then whenever the mouse pointer moves over an explicit button, it will
be emphasized in a different color or style.  This emphasis is in
addition to any non-mouse-sensitive button highlighting.

@cindex button highlighting, forcing
@findex hproperty:but-create
If you read in a file with explicit buttons before you load Hyperbole,
these buttons won't be highlighted.  Load Hyperbole and then use
@bkbd{M-x hproperty:but-create @key{RET}} to highlight the buttons in
the current buffer.

@appendix Global Key Bindings

@noindent
@cindex key binding list
This appendix summarizes all of Hyperbole's global key bindings and
whether each overrides any existing binding or not.  It also describes
how to temporarily disable these bindings and how to manage whether
Hyperbole override local, mode-specific key bindings that hide
global Hyperbole keys.

Here are descriptions of Hyperbole's default keyboard key bindings:

@ktable @kbd
@cindex key binding, M-@key{RET}
@item M-@key{RET}
Action Key: Invoke the Action Key in the present context.
@item C-u M-@key{RET}
Assist Key: Invoke the Assist Key in the present context.

@cindex key binding, C-c \
@item C-c \
HyControl: Control windows, frames and buffer display.  This binding
is made only if the key is not bound prior to loading Hyperbole.

@cindex key binding, C-c C-r
@item C-c C-r
Button Rename: Rename an explicit button. This binding is made only if
the key is not bound prior to loading Hyperbole.

@cindex key binding, M-o
@item M-o
Drag Operation: Keyboard emulation of the start and stop of mouse
drags to invoke Smart Key actions.  This binding is made only if the
key is not bound prior to loading Hyperbole and if Emacs is run under
a window system.

@cindex key binding, C-h h
@item C-h h
Hyperbole Mini Menu: Invoke the Hyperbole minibuffer menu, giving
access to many Hyperbole commands.

@cindex key binding, C-h A
@cindex key binding, C-u C-h A
@item C-h A
Action Key Help: Shows what the Action Key will do in the current context.
@item C-u C-h A
Assist Key Help: Shows what the Assist Key will do in the same context.

@cindex key binding, C-c @key{RET}
@item C-c @key{RET}
Mark Things: Marks larger and larger synctactical units in a buffer
when invoked repeatedly, showing in the minibuffer the type of unit
marked each time.  For example, if on an opening brace at the start of
a C, Java or Javascript function, this marks the whole function.  This
binding is made only if the key is not bound prior to loading
Hyperbole.

@cindex key binding, C-c .
@item C-c .
Delimited Thing Jump: Jumps between the start and end of a delimited
thing, which may be an HTML tag pair.  This binding is made only if
the key is not bound prior to loading Hyperbole.  @xref{Smart Key
Thing Selection}, for more information.
@end ktable

@vindex hkey-init
@cindex disable global key bindings
The variable, @code{hkey-init}, controls whether or not any Hyperbole
global key bindings are made.  It is set to @samp{t} (true) by default in
@file{hyperbole.el}.  This setting means all Hyperbole key bindings will
be initialized when Hyperbole is loaded.  If you want to disable these
bindings permanently, simply add @code{(setq hkey-init nil)} to
your @file{~/.emacs} file prior to the point at which you load Hyperbole
and restart Emacs.  Then you will have to choose the Hyperbole commands
that you want to use and bind those to keys.

@vindex file, .emacs
@findex hkey-toggle-bindings
@cindex change key bindings
@cindex toggle key bindings
@cindex key bindings, toggle
@cindex disable Hyperbole
@kindex C-c h
If you ever have a need to temporarily disable the Hyperbole keyboard
and mouse bindings, use the @code{hkey-toggle-bindings} command.  It
switches between the Hyperbole key bindings and those set prior to
loading Hyperbole and then back again if invoked once more.  There is
no default key binding for this command; use @bkbd{M-x
hkey-toggle-bindings @key{RET}}.  Alternatively, you may select a key
and bind it as part of any setting of @code{hyperbole-init-hook}
within your personal @file{~/.emacs} file.  For example, @code{(add-hook
'hyperbole-init-hook (lambda () (global-set-key "\C-ch"
'hkey-toggle-bindings)))}.

@vindex hkey-init-override-local-keys
@cindex overriding local keys
@cindex disable local key override
Major mode-specific keys take precedence over global key bindings.  In
some cases, a major mode will unknowingly override some of the global
Hyperbole keys, preventing you from using them in that mode.  By
default, Hyperbole automatically prevents this by checking each time a
major mode is invoked and unbinding any mode-specific keys that
interfere with global Hyperbole keys.  If you prefer that this not
happen permanently, use @bkbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET}
hkey-init-override-local-keys @key{RET}}.  Press the Toggle button to
change the value to @code{nil}.  Then select ``Apply and Save''.

@appendix Smart Key Reference

This appendix documents Hyperbole's context-sensitive Smart Key
operations.  It is quite extensive and is meant for reference rather
than sequential reading.  @xref{Smart Keys}, for a description of the
Smart Keys.  That section also describes how to get context-sensitive
Smart Key help, with which you can explore Smart Key operation bit by
bit.

What a Smart Key does depends on the context in which it is used.
Smart Key operations are context-sensitive.  Contexts are defined by
logic conditionals, e.g.@: when depressed here, if this is true, etc.
Each Smart Key context is listed in the order in which it will be
checked.  The first matching context is always the one applied.
Within each context, the actions performed by the Action and Assist
Keys are given.

The contexts and actions in this section, like drags and modeline
clicks, apply only if you have mouse support within Hyperbole.  The
Smart Key operations in @ref{Smart Keyboard Keys}, apply to both mouse
and keyboard Smart Key usage.

The following section documents what the Smart Mouse Keys do in each
context, with the contexts listed in decreasing order of priority,
i.e. the first context to match is the one that is used.  If no
matching mouse key context is found, then the keyboard key contexts
are searched in order.

There are also @emph{drag} actions that work on delimited things.
Delimited things include parenthesized lists, single and double quoted
strings, bracketed arrays/vectors, sets with braces, programming
language functions and markup pair tags (e.g. <div>
</div> in HTML).

If no region is selected when the Action Mouse Key is dragged from a
thing delimiter to another location, it copies the delimited thing to
the release point of the drag.  The release location may be in the
same or a different buffer but if in the same buffer it must be
outside of the delimited thing itself.  Similarly, the Assist Mouse
Key kills (cuts) the delimited thing at its original location and
yanks (pastes) it at the new location.

The start of the drag must be on the first character of the starting
or ending delimiter.  For strings and comments, the drag must start on
the first line of the thing.

Experiment with these drag actions and you will quickly find them easy
to use and indispensable.

If you find any errors in Hyperbole's operation or documentation, feel
free to report them to <bug-hyperbole@@gnu.org>.  Be sure to use the
Msg/Report-Hypb-Bug minibuffer menu item whenever you send a message
to this address since that command will insert important system version
information for you.

If you use Hyperbole mail or news support (@pxref{Buttons in Mail}), a
press of your Action Key on the Hyperbole mail list address will
insert a description of your Hyperbole configuration information into
your outgoing message, so that you do not have to type it.  Otherwise,
be sure to include the version numbers of your editor, Hyperbole and
your window system.  Your Hyperbole version number can be found in the
top-level Hyperbole menu.

Please use your subject line to state the position that your message
takes on the topic that it addresses, e.g.@: send "Subject: Basic bug in
top-level Hyperbole menu." rather than "Subject: Hyperbole bug".  This
simple rule makes all e-mail communication much easier.

If you have suggestions on how to improve Hyperbole, send them to

@node Questions and Answers, Future Work, Suggestion or Bug Reporting, Top
@appendix Questions and Answers

@enumerate
@item As I discover the Zen of Hyperbole, will I become so enamored of its power that I lose all control of my physical faculties?

This other-worldly reaction is of course an individual matter.  Some
people have canceled meditation trips to the Far East after
discovering that pressing the Action Key in random contexts serves a
similar purpose much more cheaply.  We have not seen anyone's mind
turn to jelly but with the thinking Hyperbole saves you, you might
just grow a second one.  Eventually, you will be at peace and will
understand that there is no adequate description of Hyperbole.

@noindent
Ok, joking aside, now that we have your attention, here are some
serious questions and answers.

@cindex Org mode
@item Isn't Org mode the same as Hyperbole?

No, they offer very different capabilities when you compare them a bit
more deeply.  In fact, it makes sense to use them together and they
are highly compatible.  The only overlap we see is that Org mode has a
more limited kind of hyperlinks and offers some BBDB integration as
Hyperbole does.

Initial Smart Key support for Org mode is already in Hyperbole and
more will come.  For a list of some differences, see:
@url{https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole}.

Org-mode offers traditional Emacs outlining, todo list management,
agenda and diary management, so it is very complementary to Hyperbole.
It did not exist when Hyperbole was first developed.  Today it is just
a matter of having time and resources to devote to finding ways to
integrate the two.  We would like to see this happen.  If you would
like to see it, offer time or money to help make it happen.

@cindex Smart Key
@cindex mouse key bindings
@findex hmouse-setup
@findex hmouse-get-bindings
@vindex file, hmouse-sh.el
@item How can I change the Smart Mouse Key bindings?

@findex hmouse-setup
@findex hmouse-get-bindings
Since the Smart Mouse Keys are set up for use under many different
Emacs configurations, there is no easy way to provide user level
customization.  Any mouse key binding changes require editing the
@code{(hmouse-setup)} and @code{(hmouse-get-bindings)} functions in the
@file{hmouse-sh.el} file.

@vindex file, hmouse-key.el
@vindex file, hui-window.el
@vindex hkey-alist
@vindex hmouse-alist
To make the Smart Keys do new things in particular contexts, define new
types of implicit buttons, @pxref{Implicit Buttons}.

The @code{hkey-alist} and @code{hmouse-alist} variables in
@file{hui-mouse.el} and @file{hui-window.el} must be altered if you want
to change what the Smart Keys do in standard contexts.  You should
then update the Smart Key summary documentation in the file,
@file{man/hkey-help.txt}, and potentially the same summary in this
manual.

@item What if I get mail with a Hyperbole button type I don't have?

Or what if someone sends a mail message with a button whose link
referent I can't access?

You receive an error that an action type is not defined or a link
referent is not accessible/readable if you try to use the button.  This
is hardly different than trying to get through a locked door without a
key; you try the doorknob, find that it is locked, and then realize that
you need to take a different approach or else give up.

Like all communication, people need to coordinate, which usually
requires an iterative process.  If you get a mail message with a button
for which you don't have the action type, you mail the sender and
request it.

@cindex global button, modify
@item How can I modify a number of global buttons in succession?

Rather than typing the name for each, it is quicker to jump to the
global button file and edit the buttons there as you would any explicit
buttons.  By default, the ButFile/PersonalFile menu item takes you to
the file where global buttons are saved at the end of the file.

@item Why are button attributes scattered across directories?

When you think of a hyper-space that you depend on every day, you
don't want to have a single point of failure that can make you
incapable of doing work.  With Hyperbole, if some directories become
unavailable for a particular time (e.g.@: the filesystems on which
they reside are dismounted) you can still work elsewhere with minimal
effect.  We believe this to be a compelling factor to leave the design
with distributed button attribute storage.

This design also permits the potential addition of buttons to read-only
media.

@item Why are action types defined apart from implicit button types?

Any category of button can make use of an action type.  Some action
types are useful as behavior definitions for a variety of button
categories, so all action types are defined separately to give them
independence from those types which apply them.

For implicit button types that require a lot of code, it is useful to
add a module that includes the implicit button type definition, its
action type definition and supporting code.  Then simply load that
module into your Emacs session.

@appendix Future Work

@noindent
This appendix is included for a number of reasons:

@itemize @bullet
@item
to better allow you to assess whether to work with Hyperbole by
providing sketches of possible additions;
@item
to direct further development effort towards known needs;
@item
and to acknowledge known weaknesses in the current system.
@end itemize

If you would like to see some of this work done, consider funding
its development.  Without any serious interest from users, progress
on these fronts will be slow.  Here are some new features we have
in mind, however.

@table @asis

@item Button Copying, Killing, and Yanking
There is as yet no means of transferring explicit buttons among
buffers. We realize this is a critical need.  Users should be able to
manipulate text with embedded buttons in ordinary ways.  With this
feature, Hyperbole would store the button attributes as text
properties within the buffers so that if a button is copied, its
attributes follow.  When a buffer is saved, the attributes also will
be saved.

@item Koutliner View Mode
This will complement the Koutliner editing mode by using simple one
character keys that normally insert characters to instead modify the
view of a Koutline and to move around in it, for ease of study.
Switching between view and edit modes will also be simple.

@item Trails
Trails are an extension to the basic history mechanism presently offered
by Hyperbole.  Trails will allow a user to capture, edit and store a
specific sequence and set of views of information for later replay by
other users.  Conditional branching may also be supported.

@item Storage of button data within button source files
The current design choice of storing buttons external to the source file
was made under the assumption that people should be able to look at
files that contain Hyperbole buttons with any standard editor or tool
and not be bothered by the ugly button data (since they won't be able to
utilize the buttons anyway, they don't need to see or have access to
them).

In many contexts, embedding the button data within the source files may
be a better choice, so a provision which would allow selection of either
configuration may be added.  Here are some of the PROs and CONs of both
design choices:

Button data external to source file
           Files can be displayed and      Currently, attributes for
           printed exactly as they look.   a whole directory are
           No special display formatting   locked when any button
           is necessary.                   entry is locked.

           Button-based searches and
           database-type lookup operations
           need only search one file
           per directory.

@end example
@sp 2

@table @asis

@item Forms-based Interfaces

This will allow one to create buttons more flexibly.  For example, button
attributes could be given in any order.  Entry of long code sequences,
quick note taking and cross-referencing would also be made easier.

@item Collaboration Support

From the early stages of Hyperbole design, collaborative work
environments have been considered.  A simple facility has demonstrated
broadcast of button activations to a number of workstations on a local
area network, so that one user can lead others around an information
space, as during an online design review.  (This facility was never
adapted to the current Hyperbole release, however).  Nowadays you
could just use a screen sharing program.
